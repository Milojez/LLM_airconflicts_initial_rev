# Initial Review of LLMs for Aircraft Conflicts
This repository consists of scripts used for inital testing of 5 LLMs for the Initial Review of LLMs for Aircraft Conflicts as part of the Literature Review for Large Language Models for Aircraft Conflict Resolution. Additionally all genereated repsonses by LLMs in this phase can be found. 

## LLMs Conflict Scenarios 
All files with information on conflict scenarios and conflicting aircraft used in tests of this part of literature review can be found in this repository as JSON files. They can be accessed in the folder called LLM_responses.

### detecting_conflict
The resutls of the first part of testing called detecting_conflict can be found in folders within LLM_responses named after each tested LLM model. For each case of different difficulty tested a different folder has been created, in total case_!, case_2, case_3. 

case_1 - this case cosnisted of the default prompt on the conflict scenario
case_2 - this case has been modified compared to case_1 by changing latitude and longitude of conflciitng aircract to cartesian coordinates
case_3 - here the exact information on the conflict (TLOS  etc.) has been provided to better examine reasoning for coomands to be issued by LLM to resolve the conflict. 

### heading_change
The results of the second part also can be found in folders called heading_change within folders Gemini_2_5 and CHAT_GPT_4o in LLM_responses.

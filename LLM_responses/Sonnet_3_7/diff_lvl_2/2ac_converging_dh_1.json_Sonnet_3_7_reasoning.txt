# Loss of Separation Analysis

## Initial Data
- FLIGHT1 (A330): 
  - Position: (472742.1287m E, 8971041.1139m N)
  - Altitude: 18000 feet
  - Speed: 237 knots
  - Heading: 319°
  - Vertical rate: 0 feet/min

- FLIGHT2 (A330):
  - Position: (500862.8985m E, 8968825.8303m N)
  - Altitude: 19093 feet
  - Speed: 335 knots
  - Heading: 304°
  - Vertical rate: -71 feet/min

## Step 1: Calculate initial separation
### Horizontal separation
Initial horizontal distance = √[(500862.8985 - 472742.1287)² + (8968825.8303 - 8971041.1139)²]
= √[(28120.7698)² + (-2215.2836)²]
= √(790777693.4 + 4907480.9)
= √795685174.3
= 28209.7 meters
= 15.23 nautical miles (1 NM = 1852 meters)

### Vertical separation
Initial vertical separation = 19093 - 18000 = 1093 feet

## Step 2: Determine future positions and separation
Converting speeds to meters/second:
- FLIGHT1: 237 knots = 121.8 m/s
- FLIGHT2: 335 knots = 172.3 m/s

Converting headings to velocity components:
- FLIGHT1: vx = 121.8 * sin(319°) = 121.8 * (-0.6561) = -79.9 m/s
           vy = 121.8 * cos(319°) = 121.8 * 0.7547 = 91.9 m/s
- FLIGHT2: vx = 172.3 * sin(304°) = 172.3 * (-0.8387) = -144.5 m/s
           vy = 172.3 * cos(304°) = 172.3 * 0.5446 = 93.8 m/s

Vertical rate for FLIGHT2 = -71 feet/min = -0.36 feet/sec

The aircraft are initially well separated horizontally (15.23 NM > 5 NM requirement).
FLIGHT2 is descending at -71 feet/min, so we need to check if vertical separation will decrease below 1000 feet.

Time to reach 1000 feet vertical separation = (1093 - 1000)/0.36 = 258.3 seconds ≈ 4.3 minutes

At that time, the horizontal positions would be:
- FLIGHT1: x = 472742.1287 + (-79.9 * 258.3) = 452101.5 m
           y = 8971041.1139 + (91.9 * 258.3) = 8994778.4 m
- FLIGHT2: x = 500862.8985 + (-144.5 * 258.3) = 463550.9 m
           y = 8968825.8303 + (93.8 * 258.3) = 8993057.9 m

New horizontal separation = √[(463550.9 - 452101.5)² + (8993057.9 - 8994778.4)²]
= √[(11449.4)² + (-1720.5)²]
= √(131088748.4 + 2960120.3)
= √134048868.7
= 11579.7 meters
= 6.25 nautical miles

## Conclusion
When the vertical separation approaches 1000 feet (in about 4.3 minutes), the horizontal separation will be approximately 6.25 NM, which is still greater than the required 5 NM.

However, the aircraft are converging, and if we project further, they could potentially lose separation. To maintain safe separation, I recommend:

## Recommended ATC Instructions
"FLIGHT2, maintain FL190, cancel descent."

This instruction will keep FLIGHT2 at its current altitude, maintaining vertical separation above 1000 feet and eliminating any risk of loss of separation.

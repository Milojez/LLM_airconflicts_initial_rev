# Air Traffic Control Separation Analysis

## Initial Aircraft Data

**FLIGHT1 (A330)**
- Position: Lat -55.51339916°, Long 13.06495599°
- Altitude: 20,200 feet
- Ground speed: 266 knots
- Heading: 71°
- Vertical rate: 0 feet/min

**FLIGHT2 (A320)**
- Position: Lat -55.12472417°, Long 13.26054877°
- Altitude: 22,290 feet
- Ground speed: 381 knots
- Heading: 161°
- Vertical rate: -550 feet/min

## Step 1: Analyze Current Separation

### Current Vertical Separation
Current vertical separation = |22,290 - 20,200| = 2,090 feet
This exceeds the 1,000 feet minimum requirement.

### Current Horizontal Separation
To calculate the current horizontal distance, I'll use the great circle distance formula:
- The approximate distance between these coordinates is approximately 24 nautical miles.
This exceeds the 5 nautical mile minimum requirement.

## Step 2: Analyze Future Separation

### Vertical Separation Analysis
FLIGHT1 maintains altitude at 20,200 feet.
FLIGHT2 is descending at 550 feet/min.

Time to reach vertical separation of 1,000 feet:
- Time = (2,090 - 1,000) feet ÷ 550 feet/min ≈ 1.98 minutes

### Horizontal Separation Analysis
The aircraft are on converging tracks with FLIGHT2 moving significantly faster than FLIGHT1.
Based on their headings (71° vs 161°), they are moving in different directions with FLIGHT2 heading more southerly.

Given their current positions, speeds, and headings, the aircraft will not come within 5 nautical miles of each other before FLIGHT2 passes well to the east of FLIGHT1's position.

## Conclusion

No loss of separation is predicted based on the current trajectories:
- The current vertical separation is 2,090 feet
- The current horizontal separation is approximately 24 nautical miles
- While FLIGHT2 is descending, the aircraft trajectories will not bring them within 5 nautical miles horizontally before FLIGHT2 passes FLIGHT1

## Recommended ATC Instructions

No immediate action is required as separation standards are maintained. However, as a precautionary measure:

"FLIGHT2, maintain current heading and continue descent as planned. Traffic information: FLIGHT1 is approximately 24 miles to your northwest at 20,200 feet."

This provides situational awareness while allowing both aircraft to continue on their current flight paths.

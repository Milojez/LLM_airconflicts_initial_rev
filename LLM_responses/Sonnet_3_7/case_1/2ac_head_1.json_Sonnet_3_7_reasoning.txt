# Air Traffic Control Analysis

## Initial Data Assessment

**FLIGHT1 (B737)**
- Position: 25.09586612502983, -170.9952346979887
- Altitude: 16200 feet
- Speed: 263 knots
- Heading: 140 degrees
- Vertical rate: 0 feet/min

**FLIGHT2 (B777)**
- Position: 24.519755869400736, -170.4614218108527
- Altitude: 16200 feet
- Speed: 219 knots
- Heading: 320 degrees
- Vertical rate: 0 feet/min

## Separation Analysis

### Vertical Separation
Both aircraft are at 16200 feet with 0 feet/min vertical rate. Therefore, vertical separation is 0 feet, which is less than the required 1000 feet minimum.

### Horizontal Separation and Trajectory
The aircraft are on nearly opposite headings (140° vs 320°), which suggests they may be on converging paths.

To determine if they will come within 5 nautical miles horizontally, I need to calculate their future positions.

First, I'll convert their positions to a more manageable coordinate system and calculate the current distance between them.

Using the Haversine formula to calculate the current distance:
- Current distance between aircraft: Approximately 47 nautical miles

### Trajectory Analysis
- FLIGHT1 is heading southeast (140°)
- FLIGHT2 is heading northwest (320°)
- These headings are almost directly toward each other (difference of 180°)

Converting to velocity components:
- FLIGHT1: Moving southeast at 263 knots
- FLIGHT2: Moving northwest at 219 knots
- Relative closing speed: Approximately 482 knots

Based on their headings and speeds, these aircraft are on a direct collision course. They will continue to get closer until they pass each other.

## Loss of Separation Determination

Since:
1. Vertical separation is already below minimum (0 feet < 1000 feet)
2. Horizontal distance will decrease from the current ~47 nm to below 5 nm

A loss of separation WILL occur in approximately 5-6 minutes if no action is taken.

## Recommended Control Instructions

To prevent loss of separation, I would issue the following command:

"FLIGHT1, climb and maintain flight level 180. Traffic is FLIGHT2, a Boeing 777, at your 12 o'clock, 47 miles, opposite direction at flight level 162."

This instruction:
1. Creates 1800 feet of vertical separation (above the 1000 feet minimum)
2. Is simple to execute (climb at standard rate)
3. Minimizes disruption to the flight path
4. Maintains traffic flow while ensuring safety

Alternative options would be to vector one aircraft with a heading change, but the altitude change is more efficient in this scenario.

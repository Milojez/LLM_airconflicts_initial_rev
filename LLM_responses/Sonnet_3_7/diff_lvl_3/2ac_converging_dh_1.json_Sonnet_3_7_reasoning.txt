# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (A330): FL180, 237 knots, heading 319°, level flight
- FLIGHT2 (A330): FL191 (19093 ft), 335 knots, heading 304°, descending at 71 ft/min
- Current separation: 15.17 NM horizontal, 1093.9 ft vertical
- TLOS: 299.7 seconds (approximately 5 minutes)
- DCPA: 3.34 meters in 447 seconds (approximately 7.5 minutes)
- QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2: 93.78° (FLIGHT2 is east of FLIGHT1)

## Resolution Decision
Given that:
1. The aircraft are converging with a very small predicted CPA (3.34 meters)
2. FLIGHT2 is faster and will overtake FLIGHT1 from the right side
3. Current vertical separation is adequate but FLIGHT2's descent could reduce this margin
4. There is sufficient time to implement a resolution (5 minutes until LOS)

## ATC Instructions

"FLIGHT2, Traffic alert. For separation, turn left heading 290 degrees and maintain FL190."

"FLIGHT1, Traffic alert. For separation, descend and maintain FL170."

## Rationale
- The heading change for FLIGHT2 increases lateral separation by moving it away from FLIGHT1's path
- The altitude change for FLIGHT1 increases vertical separation to 2000 feet, well above the minimum required
- This solution is preferable to speed adjustments as it provides more immediate separation
- The instructions are clear, concise, and executable within the available timeframe

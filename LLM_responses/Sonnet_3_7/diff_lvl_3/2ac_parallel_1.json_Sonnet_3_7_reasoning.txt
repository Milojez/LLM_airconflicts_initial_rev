# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (B747) and FLIGHT2 (A330) are both at 25,200 feet
- Both aircraft are on the same heading (216Â°)
- FLIGHT2 is faster (412 knots) than FLIGHT1 (245 knots)
- FLIGHT2 is behind FLIGHT1 and overtaking
- Loss of separation predicted in approximately 5 minutes (299.1 seconds)
- Extremely close CPA predicted (15.73 meters)
- This is an overtaking scenario on the same track

## Recommended Control Instructions

Given the urgency of the situation and the aircraft parameters, I would issue the following instructions:

**To FLIGHT2 (A330):**
"FLIGHT2, traffic alert. FLIGHT1 is ahead of you on the same track. Turn right heading 230 degrees immediately to maintain separation."

**To FLIGHT1 (B747):**
"FLIGHT1, traffic alert. For separation from traffic behind you, descend immediately to flight level 240, maintain present heading."

## Rationale
1. The vertical separation (1,000 feet) provides immediate conflict resolution
2. The heading change for FLIGHT2 creates lateral separation
3. This solution minimizes disruption while ensuring safe separation
4. Assigning altitude change to FLIGHT1 and heading change to FLIGHT2 distributes the control burden

I'll continue to monitor the situation and may issue additional instructions if separation does not improve as expected.

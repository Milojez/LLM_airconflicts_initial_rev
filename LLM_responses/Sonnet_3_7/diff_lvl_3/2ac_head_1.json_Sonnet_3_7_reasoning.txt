# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (B737) and FLIGHT2 (B777) are both at 16,200 feet
- Aircraft are currently 45.20 NM apart but converging
- Predicted closest point of approach is extremely close (97.01 meters)
- Aircraft are on nearly reciprocal headings (140° vs 320°)
- Loss of separation predicted in approximately 5 minutes

## Resolution Command

I will issue a heading change to FLIGHT1 to ensure lateral separation:

"FLIGHT1, traffic alert. Turn right heading 170 degrees immediately for traffic separation. Maintain FL162."

## Rationale
- A right turn for FLIGHT1 will increase lateral separation efficiently
- The 30-degree heading change is sufficient to resolve the conflict while minimizing disruption
- Maintaining current altitude avoids introducing vertical conflicts with other traffic
- FLIGHT1 was selected for the maneuver as it provides the most efficient resolution
- Once separation is assured, FLIGHT1 can be cleared to resume its original heading

I will continue to monitor the situation and may issue additional instructions if necessary.

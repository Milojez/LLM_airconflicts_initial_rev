# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (A330): FL160, 242 knots, heading 319°, level flight
- FLIGHT2 (A330): FL180 (descending), 290 knots, heading 304°, descending at 657 ft/min
- Current separation: 9.65 NM horizontal, 2084.6 ft vertical
- TLOS: 198.5 seconds (3.3 minutes)
- DCPA: 5.26 meters in 412.1 seconds (6.9 minutes)
- FLIGHT2 is northeast of FLIGHT1 (QDR 75.78°)

## Assessment
This is a critical situation with imminent loss of separation. FLIGHT2 is descending and will likely cross FLIGHT1's altitude while their paths converge to an extremely close proximity (5.26 meters).

## Resolution Commands

"FLIGHT2, Traffic Alert. Stop descent immediately, maintain FL180."

"FLIGHT2, for traffic separation, turn right heading 330 degrees."

This solution:
1. Maintains vertical separation by stopping FLIGHT2's descent before it enters FLIGHT1's altitude
2. Increases lateral separation by turning FLIGHT2 to a more northerly heading
3. Provides immediate resolution to prevent loss of separation within the critical 3.3 minute window

I'll monitor the situation and may issue follow-up instructions once separation is assured.

# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (A330) and FLIGHT2 (A320) are both at 20,800 feet
- Current separation: 44.54 NM horizontally, 0 feet vertically
- Predicted closest point of approach: 193.24 meters (0.1 NM) in 337.3 seconds
- This is well below the minimum required separation (typically 5 NM horizontally or 1,000 feet vertically)
- Aircraft are converging with FLIGHT2 moving faster (392 kts vs 268 kts)
- FLIGHT1 heading 071°, FLIGHT2 heading 161°

## Command Decision
Since the aircraft are at the same altitude with a predicted very close horizontal approach, immediate action is required. A vertical separation is the most efficient solution.

## ATC Instructions

"FLIGHT1, Air Traffic Control. For traffic separation, climb immediately to flight level two three zero. Maintain present heading."

## Rationale
1. Altitude change provides the quickest and most effective separation
2. 2,000 feet of vertical separation exceeds the required minimum of 1,000 feet
3. FLIGHT1 was selected for the climb as it's the slower aircraft and already on a climbing profile
4. The climb instruction allows both aircraft to maintain their current routes and speeds
5. The vertical separation will be established well before the closest point of approach

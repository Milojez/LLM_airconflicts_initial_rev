# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (A330): FL202, 266 knots, heading 071°, level flight
- FLIGHT2 (A320): FL223, 381 knots, heading 161°, descending at 550 ft/min
- Current separation: 24.28 NM horizontal, 2091 ft vertical
- TLOS: 149.3 seconds (critical timeframe)
- DCPA: 56.85 meters in 188 seconds (extremely close predicted proximity)
- QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2: 15.98° (FLIGHT2 is northeast of FLIGHT1)

## Resolution Command

**To FLIGHT2:**
"FLIGHT2, traffic alert. Turn right heading 190 degrees immediately for traffic separation. Maintain current descent rate. Report new heading established."

## Rationale
1. FLIGHT2 is the faster aircraft (381 knots vs 266 knots) and already has a vertical separation advantage.
2. A right turn for FLIGHT2 will increase lateral separation at the predicted conflict point.
3. The heading change from 161° to 190° (29° turn) will efficiently resolve the conflict while minimizing disruption to FLIGHT2's route.
4. Maintaining the current descent rate will continue to increase vertical separation.
5. This solution avoids disrupting FLIGHT1's flight path and is the most efficient resolution with minimal impact on both flights.

I'll continue monitoring the situation and may issue additional instructions if separation does not improve as expected.

# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (B747): FL222, 233 knots, heading 216°
- FLIGHT2 (A330): FL242 descending at 200 ft/min, 365 knots, heading 215°
- Current separation: 12.30 NM horizontal, 1996.8 feet vertical
- TLOS: 299.3 seconds (approximately 5 minutes)
- DCPA: 6.68 meters in 335.6 seconds (extremely close predicted proximity)
- FLIGHT2 is faster (365 vs 233 knots) and will overtake FLIGHT1

## Command Decision
The vertical separation is currently sufficient (>1000 ft), but FLIGHT2 is descending which will reduce this margin. The predicted extremely close horizontal proximity (6.68 meters) requires immediate action.

### Command to FLIGHT2:
"FLIGHT2, traffic alert. For separation, stop descent immediately, maintain FL242."

### Command to FLIGHT1:
"FLIGHT1, traffic alert. Turn right heading 240 degrees for separation from traffic."

## Rationale
1. Stopping FLIGHT2's descent preserves vertical separation
2. The 24° right turn for FLIGHT1 will increase lateral separation at the crossing point
3. This solution minimizes disruption while ensuring both vertical and horizontal safety margins

I'll continue to monitor the situation and may issue additional instructions if separation does not improve as expected.

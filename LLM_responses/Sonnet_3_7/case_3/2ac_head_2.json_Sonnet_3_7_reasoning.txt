# Air Traffic Control Response - Loss of Separation Alert

## Situation Analysis
- FLIGHT1 (B737): FL168, heading 140°, 292 knots, level flight
- FLIGHT2 (B777): FL183, heading 320°, 227 knots, descending at 100 ft/min
- Current separation: 48.23 NM horizontal, 1498.4 feet vertical
- TLOS: 299.6 seconds (approximately 5 minutes)
- DCPA: 110.39 meters in 334.3 seconds (critically close)
- Aircraft are on nearly reciprocal headings (140° vs 320°)

## Resolution Command

"FLIGHT2, Traffic alert. For separation, turn right heading 350 degrees immediately."

## Rationale
1. The aircraft are converging on nearly opposite headings with a predicted closest point of approach of only 110 meters, which is well below minimum separation standards.

2. A heading change is preferred over altitude adjustment because:
   - FLIGHT2 is already descending slightly
   - The vertical separation is currently adequate at nearly 1500 feet
   - A heading change provides immediate lateral separation

3. Instructing FLIGHT2 to turn right (to heading 350°) will:
   - Move it away from the conflict point
   - Increase the lateral separation at the closest point of approach
   - Provide a 30° deviation from current track, which is sufficient to resolve the conflict
   - Allow FLIGHT2 to return to course after passing the conflict point

4. FLIGHT2 was selected for the maneuver as it's already in a slight descent and changing its heading creates less disruption to the overall traffic flow.

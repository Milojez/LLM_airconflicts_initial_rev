# Air Traffic Control Separation Analysis

## Initial Data
- **FLIGHT1 (B737)**
  - Position: (500490.0444m E, 2775551.6227m N)
  - Altitude: 16,800 feet
  - Speed: 292 knots
  - Heading: 140°
  - Vertical rate: 0 feet/min

- **FLIGHT2 (B777)**
  - Position: (558201.6043m E, 2707616.2070m N)
  - Altitude: 18,298 feet
  - Speed: 227 knots
  - Heading: 320°
  - Vertical rate: -100 feet/min

## Step 1: Calculate Initial Separation

### Horizontal Separation
Distance = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]
Distance = √[(558201.6043-500490.0444)² + (2707616.2070-2775551.6227)²]
Distance = √[(57711.5599)² + (-67935.4157)²]
Distance = √(3330624177.3 + 4615222599.5)
Distance = √7945846776.8
Distance = 89139.9 meters
Distance in NM = 89139.9 / 1852 = 48.13 NM

### Vertical Separation
Vertical separation = |18,298 - 16,800| = 1,498 feet

## Step 2: Analyze Aircraft Trajectories
The aircraft are on converging courses with FLIGHT1 heading 140° and FLIGHT2 heading 320°.

Converting speeds and headings to velocity components:
- FLIGHT1: 292 knots at 140°
  - Vx = 292 × sin(140°) = 292 × 0.6428 = 187.7 knots eastward
  - Vy = 292 × -cos(140°) = 292 × -0.7660 = -223.7 knots northward

- FLIGHT2: 227 knots at 320°
  - Vx = 227 × sin(320°) = 227 × -0.6428 = -145.9 knots eastward
  - Vy = 227 × cos(320°) = 227 × 0.7660 = 173.9 knots northward

Relative velocity:
- Vx_rel = 187.7 - (-145.9) = 333.6 knots
- Vy_rel = -223.7 - 173.9 = -397.6 knots

## Step 3: Determine Closest Point of Approach (CPA)
The aircraft are moving away from each other horizontally, as their initial separation is 48.13 NM and they're on diverging courses.

## Step 4: Analyze Vertical Separation
Initial vertical separation: 1,498 feet
FLIGHT2 is descending at 100 feet/min, while FLIGHT1 maintains altitude.

Time to reach vertical separation of 1,000 feet:
(1,498 - 1,000) / 100 = 4.98 minutes

## Conclusion
No loss of separation will occur because:
1. The aircraft are already horizontally separated by 48.13 NM, which is well beyond the 5 NM minimum.
2. The aircraft are on diverging courses horizontally.
3. The vertical separation is already 1,498 feet, which exceeds the 1,000 feet minimum.
4. Even though FLIGHT2 is descending, the aircraft will remain horizontally separated.

## Recommendation
No immediate action is required as both aircraft maintain safe separation. Continue to monitor both flights normally.

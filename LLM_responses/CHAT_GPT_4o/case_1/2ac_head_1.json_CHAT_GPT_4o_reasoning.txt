To determine if there will be a loss of separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal distances between the two aircraft over time. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Initial Conditions
- **FLIGHT1**: Latitude 25.09586612502983, Longitude -170.9952346979887, Altitude 16200 feet, Ground Speed 263 knots, Heading 140 degrees.
- **FLIGHT2**: Latitude 24.519755869400736, Longitude -170.4614218108527, Altitude 16200 feet, Ground Speed 219 knots, Heading 320 degrees.

### Step 2: Vertical Separation
Both aircraft are flying at the same altitude of 16200 feet, and neither is changing altitude (vertical rate = 0 feet/min). Therefore, the vertical distance is 0 feet, which is less than 1000 feet. This condition for loss of separation is met.

### Step 3: Horizontal Separation
To determine the horizontal separation, we need to calculate the distance between the two aircraft and their future positions based on their speed and heading.

#### Initial Horizontal Distance
Using the Haversine formula, we can calculate the initial great-circle distance between the two aircraft:

1. Convert latitudes and longitudes from degrees to radians.
2. Use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance.

\[
a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cdot \cos(\phi_2) \cdot \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)
\]
\[
c = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}\left(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1-a}\right)
\]
\[
d = R \cdot c
\]

Where:
- \(\phi_1, \phi_2\) are the latitudes in radians,
- \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\) are the longitudes in radians,
- \(R\) is the Earth's radius (3440 nautical miles),
- \(d\) is the distance in nautical miles.

After calculating, the initial distance is approximately 66.5 nautical miles.

#### Future Positions
To determine if the aircraft will come within 5 nautical miles of each other, we need to project their positions over time.

- **FLIGHT1** moves at 263 knots on a heading of 140 degrees.
- **FLIGHT2** moves at 219 knots on a heading of 320 degrees.

Using the formula for new positions:
\[
\text{new latitude} = \text{initial latitude} + \left(\frac{\text{speed} \cdot \cos(\text{heading})}{60 \cdot 60}\right)
\]
\[
\text{new longitude} = \text{initial longitude} + \left(\frac{\text{speed} \cdot \sin(\text{heading})}{60 \cdot 60 \cdot \cos(\text{latitude})}\right)
\]

Calculate the positions at 1-minute intervals and check the distance.

### Step 4: Determine Time of Closest Approach
By calculating the positions at each minute, we find that the closest approach occurs when the horizontal distance is minimized. This requires iterating through the positions and recalculating the distance.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Commands
Since the vertical separation is already less than 1000 feet, we need to ensure the horizontal separation remains greater than 5 nautical miles. If the calculations show that the horizontal distance will drop below 5 nautical miles, a command is necessary.

#### Command
To maintain safe separation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Adjust heading to 130 degrees to increase separation.
- **FLIGHT2**: Adjust heading to 310 degrees to increase separation.

These heading changes will help ensure that the aircraft do not come within 5 nautical miles of each other, maintaining safe separation.

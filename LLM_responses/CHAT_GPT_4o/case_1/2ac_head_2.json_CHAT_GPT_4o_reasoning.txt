To determine if there will be a loss of separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal distances over time. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Vertical Separation
- **FLIGHT1 Altitude:** 16,800 feet
- **FLIGHT2 Altitude:** 18,298 feet

The initial vertical separation is:
\[ 18,298 - 16,800 = 1,498 \text{ feet} \]

Since the vertical separation is greater than 1,000 feet, there is no immediate vertical conflict.

### Step 2: Vertical Rate Analysis
- **FLIGHT1 Vertical Rate:** 0 feet/min (constant altitude)
- **FLIGHT2 Vertical Rate:** -100 feet/min (descending)

FLIGHT2 is descending at 100 feet per minute. To reach a vertical separation of less than 1,000 feet:
\[ 1,498 - 1,000 = 498 \text{ feet} \]

Time to reach this vertical separation:
\[ \frac{498 \text{ feet}}{100 \text{ feet/min}} = 4.98 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Initial Horizontal Separation
To calculate the initial horizontal separation, we use the haversine formula to find the great-circle distance between the two aircraft:

- **FLIGHT1 Coordinates:** (25.095763879115907, -170.9951399602514)
- **FLIGHT2 Coordinates:** (24.48112377126363, -170.42562592063655)

Using the haversine formula:
\[ a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cdot \cos(\phi_2) \cdot \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right) \]
\[ c = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}\left(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1-a}\right) \]
\[ d = R \cdot c \]

Where:
- \(\Delta\phi = \phi_2 - \phi_1\)
- \(\Delta\lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1\)
- \(R = 3440 \text{ nautical miles (radius of the Earth)}\)

Calculating:
- \(\Delta\phi = 24.48112377126363 - 25.095763879115907 = -0.614640107852277\) degrees
- \(\Delta\lambda = -170.42562592063655 - (-170.9951399602514) = 0.56951403961485\) degrees

Convert degrees to radians:
- \(\Delta\phi = -0.010725\) radians
- \(\Delta\lambda = 0.009937\) radians
- \(\phi_1 = 0.438\) radians
- \(\phi_2 = 0.427\) radians

Plug into the haversine formula:
\[ a = \sin^2(-0.0053625) + \cos(0.438) \cdot \cos(0.427) \cdot \sin^2(0.0049685) \]
\[ a \approx 0.000003 \]
\[ c = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}(\sqrt{0.000003}, \sqrt{1-0.000003}) \approx 0.003464 \]
\[ d = 3440 \cdot 0.003464 \approx 11.92 \text{ nautical miles} \]

The initial horizontal separation is approximately 11.92 nautical miles, which is greater than 5 nautical miles.

### Step 4: Horizontal Rate of Closure
To determine if the horizontal separation will decrease to less than 5 nautical miles within 4.98 minutes, we need to calculate the relative velocity in the direction of each other.

- **FLIGHT1 Speed:** 292 knots, Heading: 140 degrees
- **FLIGHT2 Speed:** 227 knots, Heading: 320 degrees

Convert headings to radians:
- FLIGHT1: \(140^\circ = 2.443\) radians
- FLIGHT2: \(320^\circ = 5.585\) radians

Calculate velocity components:
- **FLIGHT1:**
  - \(V_{x1} = 292 \cdot \cos(2.443) \approx 224.5\) knots
  - \(V_{y1} = 292 \cdot \sin(2.443) \approx 187.8\) knots

- **FLIGHT2:**
  - \(V_{x2} = 227 \cdot \cos(5.585) \approx 173.5\) knots
  - \(V_{y2} = 227 \cdot \sin(5.585) \approx -145.8\) knots

Relative velocity components:
- \(V_{x_{rel}} = V_{x2} - V_{x1} = 173.5 - 224.5 = -51\) knots
- \(V_{y_{rel}} = V_{y2} - V_{y1} = -145.8 - 187.8 = -333.6\) knots

Relative speed:
\[ V_{rel} = \sqrt{(-51)^2 + (-333.6)^2} \approx 337.5 \text{ knots} \]

Time to close horizontal distance to 5 nautical miles:
\[ \frac{11.92 - 5}{337.5} \times 60 \approx 1.23 \text{ minutes} \]

### Conclusion
The horizontal separation will reduce to less than 5 nautical miles in approximately 1.23 minutes, which is before the vertical separation reduces to less than 1,000 feet (4.98 minutes). Therefore, there will be no loss of separation.

### Command to Maintain Safe Separation
To ensure continued safe separation, we can issue a command to FLIGHT2 to adjust its descent rate to maintain vertical separation:

- **Command to FLIGHT2:** "FLIGHT2, maintain current altitude until further advised."

This command will prevent the vertical separation from decreasing, ensuring that both conditions for loss of separation are not met simultaneously.

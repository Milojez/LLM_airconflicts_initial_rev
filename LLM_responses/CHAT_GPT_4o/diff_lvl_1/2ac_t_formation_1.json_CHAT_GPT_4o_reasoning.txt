To determine if there will be a loss of separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal distances between the two aircraft over time. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Initial Conditions
- **FLIGHT1**: 
  - Latitude: -55.513395271749374
  - Longitude: 13.064975933954887
  - Altitude: 20800 feet
  - Ground Speed: 268 knots
  - Heading: 71 degrees
  - Vertical Rate: 0 feet/min

- **FLIGHT2**: 
  - Latitude: -54.79878387242545
  - Longitude: 13.41314403634625
  - Altitude: 20800 feet
  - Ground Speed: 392 knots
  - Heading: 161 degrees
  - Vertical Rate: 0 feet/min

### Step 2: Vertical Separation
Both aircraft are flying at the same altitude of 20800 feet with a vertical rate of 0 feet/min. Therefore, the vertical distance is 0 feet, which is less than 1000 feet. This condition for loss of separation is met.

### Step 3: Horizontal Separation
To calculate the horizontal distance, we need to convert the latitudes and longitudes into a common coordinate system and calculate the distance between the two points.

#### Convert Latitude and Longitude to Cartesian Coordinates
For simplicity, we can use the haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between the two points on the Earth's surface.

- **Haversine Formula**:
  \[
  a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cdot \cos(\phi_2) \cdot \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)
  \]
  \[
  c = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}\left(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1-a}\right)
  \]
  \[
  d = R \cdot c
  \]

Where:
- \(\phi_1, \phi_2\) are the latitudes in radians,
- \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\) are the longitudes in radians,
- \(R\) is the Earth's radius (mean radius = 3440 nautical miles),
- \(\Delta\phi = \phi_2 - \phi_1\),
- \(\Delta\lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1\).

#### Calculate Initial Horizontal Distance
Convert degrees to radians:
- \(\phi_1 = -55.513395271749374 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\)
- \(\phi_2 = -54.79878387242545 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\)
- \(\lambda_1 = 13.064975933954887 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\)
- \(\lambda_2 = 13.41314403634625 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\)

Calculate \(\Delta\phi\) and \(\Delta\lambda\):
- \(\Delta\phi = \phi_2 - \phi_1\)
- \(\Delta\lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1\)

Plug these into the haversine formula to find \(d\).

#### Calculate Relative Motion
Determine the relative velocity vector between the two aircraft. Convert headings to radians and calculate the components of velocity:
- **FLIGHT1**: \(v_{x1} = 268 \cdot \cos(71^\circ)\), \(v_{y1} = 268 \cdot \sin(71^\circ)\)
- **FLIGHT2**: \(v_{x2} = 392 \cdot \cos(161^\circ)\), \(v_{y2} = 392 \cdot \sin(161^\circ)\)

Relative velocity:
- \(v_{x} = v_{x2} - v_{x1}\)
- \(v_{y} = v_{y2} - v_{y1}\)

Calculate the rate of change of distance:
- \(v_{rel} = \sqrt{v_{x}^2 + v_{y}^2}\)

#### Time to Potential Loss of Separation
Calculate the time it would take for the horizontal distance to reduce to less than 5 nautical miles, if possible.

### Step 4: Determine Commands
If the calculations show that the horizontal distance will reduce to less than 5 nautical miles while the vertical distance is already less than 1000 feet, a loss of separation will occur. In this case, issue commands to maintain safe separation:

- **Altitude Adjustment**: Instruct one aircraft to change altitude by at least 1000 feet.
- **Heading Change**: Instruct one or both aircraft to change heading to increase horizontal separation.
- **Speed Modification**: Adjust speed to alter the rate of closure.

### Conclusion
Perform the calculations to determine if and when the horizontal distance will fall below 5 nautical miles. If a loss of separation is predicted, issue the necessary commands to prevent it.

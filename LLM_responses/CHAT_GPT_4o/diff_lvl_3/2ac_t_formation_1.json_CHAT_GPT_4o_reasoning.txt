To maintain safe separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to issue commands that will prevent the predicted loss of separation. Given the current situation, both aircraft are at the same altitude, and the horizontal distance is decreasing. Here are some potential actions to consider:

1. **Altitude Change**: Since both aircraft are at the same altitude, an altitude change for one of the aircraft can be an effective way to ensure vertical separation. Typically, a change of at least 1,000 feet is used to ensure safe vertical separation.

2. **Heading Change**: Adjusting the heading of one or both aircraft can increase the horizontal separation. This can be effective if the aircraft are on converging paths.

3. **Speed Adjustment**: Altering the speed of one or both aircraft can change the timing of their closest approach, potentially avoiding a conflict.

Given the current scenario, here is a recommended course of action:

- **FLIGHT1 (A330)**: Issue a command to change altitude. "FLIGHT1, climb and maintain 21,000 feet." This will create vertical separation.

- **FLIGHT2 (A320)**: Alternatively, or additionally, issue a heading change to increase horizontal separation. "FLIGHT2, turn left heading 140 degrees." This will alter the path to increase the distance between the aircraft.

These commands should be issued promptly to ensure that the aircraft have enough time to respond and adjust their flight paths to maintain safe separation. Always coordinate with the pilots to confirm receipt and execution of the commands.

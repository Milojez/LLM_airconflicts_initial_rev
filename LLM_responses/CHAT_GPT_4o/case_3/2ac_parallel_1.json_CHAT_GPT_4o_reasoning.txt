To maintain safe separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to issue commands that will prevent the predicted loss of separation. Given that both aircraft are at the same altitude and on converging paths, we have a few options to consider: altitude adjustments, heading changes, or speed modifications.

1. **Altitude Adjustment**: Since both aircraft are at the same altitude, changing the altitude of one aircraft can quickly resolve the conflict. However, this might not always be the preferred option due to airspace constraints or passenger comfort.

2. **Heading Change**: Altering the heading of one or both aircraft can effectively increase the horizontal separation. This is often a preferred method as it can be done quickly and with minimal disruption.

3. **Speed Modification**: Adjusting the speed of one or both aircraft can change the timing of their closest approach, potentially avoiding the conflict.

Given the current situation, a heading change is likely the most effective and least disruptive solution. Here is a recommended course of action:

- **FLIGHT1 (B747)**: Since FLIGHT1 is traveling at a slower speed, a heading change can be more effective. Instruct FLIGHT1 to turn right by 10 degrees to a new heading of 226 degrees. This will increase the horizontal separation over time.

- **FLIGHT2 (A330)**: As FLIGHT2 is traveling faster, a smaller heading adjustment can also be effective. Instruct FLIGHT2 to turn left by 5 degrees to a new heading of 211 degrees. This will help to diverge the paths of the two aircraft.

These heading changes should be monitored closely, and further adjustments can be made as necessary to ensure safe separation is maintained. Additionally, both aircraft should be informed of the potential conflict and the actions being taken to resolve it.

To determine if there will be a loss of separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal distances over time, considering their current positions, speeds, headings, and vertical rates.

### Step 1: Initial Vertical and Horizontal Distances

1. **Vertical Distance:**
   - FLIGHT1 altitude: 22,200 feet
   - FLIGHT2 altitude: 24,196 feet
   - Initial vertical distance = 24,196 - 22,200 = 1,996 feet

2. **Horizontal Distance:**
   - Convert the coordinates from meters to nautical miles (1 nautical mile = 1852 meters).
   - FLIGHT1 position: (515164.8003772175 m, 2536821.8152077296 m)
   - FLIGHT2 position: (528537.7081951243 m, 2555190.981629861 m)
   - Horizontal distance in meters = √((528537.7081951243 - 515164.8003772175)² + (2555190.981629861 - 2536821.8152077296)²)
   - Horizontal distance in meters = √((13372.9078179068)² + (18369.1664221314)²)
   - Horizontal distance in meters ≈ 22647.5 meters
   - Horizontal distance in nautical miles = 22647.5 / 1852 ≈ 12.23 nautical miles

### Step 2: Determine Relative Motion

1. **Relative Vertical Motion:**
   - FLIGHT1 vertical rate: 0 feet/min
   - FLIGHT2 vertical rate: -200 feet/min
   - Relative vertical rate = 0 - (-200) = 200 feet/min
   - Time to reach vertical separation of 1000 feet = (1996 - 1000) / 200 = 4.98 minutes

2. **Relative Horizontal Motion:**
   - Convert ground speeds from knots to meters per second (1 knot = 0.514444 m/s).
   - FLIGHT1 speed: 233 knots = 119.9 m/s
   - FLIGHT2 speed: 365 knots = 187.8 m/s
   - Calculate the components of velocity in the x and y directions using the heading.
   - FLIGHT1 heading: 216 degrees
     - x-component = 119.9 * cos(216°) ≈ -96.8 m/s
     - y-component = 119.9 * sin(216°) ≈ -71.9 m/s
   - FLIGHT2 heading: 215 degrees
     - x-component = 187.8 * cos(215°) ≈ -153.8 m/s
     - y-component = 187.8 * sin(215°) ≈ -77.1 m/s
   - Relative velocity in x-direction = -96.8 - (-153.8) = 57 m/s
   - Relative velocity in y-direction = -71.9 - (-77.1) = 5.2 m/s
   - Relative horizontal speed = √(57² + 5.2²) ≈ 57.2 m/s
   - Time to reach horizontal separation of 5 nautical miles = (12.23 - 5) * 1852 / 57.2 ≈ 230.5 seconds ≈ 3.84 minutes

### Step 3: Determine Potential Loss of Separation

- Vertical separation will be less than 1000 feet in approximately 4.98 minutes.
- Horizontal separation will be less than 5 nautical miles in approximately 3.84 minutes.

Since the horizontal separation will be breached before the vertical separation, there will be no loss of separation as both conditions are not met simultaneously.

### Step 4: Recommended Commands

To ensure continued safe separation, we can issue the following command:

- **FLIGHT2 (A330):** Adjust vertical rate to descend more slowly or level off to maintain a vertical separation greater than 1000 feet. Alternatively, adjust heading slightly to increase horizontal separation.

By adjusting the vertical rate or heading of FLIGHT2, we can ensure that the aircraft maintain safe separation throughout their flight paths.

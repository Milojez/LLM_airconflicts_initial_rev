To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1** is heading 140 degrees.
- **FLIGHT2** is heading 320 degrees.
- Both aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 feet), so vertical separation is not an option.
- The current horizontal distance is 42.18 nautical miles, but it is predicted to reduce to 84.49 meters (approximately 0.0456 nautical miles) at the closest point of approach.

### Objective:
- Adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to increase the horizontal separation at the closest point of approach to at least 5 nautical miles.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Heading and Conflict Direction:**
   - FLIGHT1 is heading 140 degrees.
   - The azimuthal direction (QDR) from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.94 degrees, indicating that FLIGHT2 is almost directly ahead of FLIGHT1.

2. **Optimal Heading Change:**
   - To increase separation, FLIGHT1 should alter its course away from the direction of FLIGHT2.
   - Since FLIGHT2 is on a reciprocal heading (320 degrees), FLIGHT1 should turn to the left (counter-clockwise) to increase the distance between the two aircraft.

3. **Proposed Heading Change:**
   - A significant heading change is required to ensure the horizontal separation remains above 5 nautical miles.
   - A left turn to a heading of approximately 90 degrees (eastward) would effectively increase the lateral separation, as it would create a perpendicular path relative to FLIGHT2's trajectory.

### Command:
- **FLIGHT1, turn left heading 090 degrees.**

### Rationale:
- By turning FLIGHT1 to a heading of 090 degrees, the aircraft will move eastward, increasing the lateral separation from FLIGHT2, which is moving northwest (heading 320 degrees).
- This heading change maximizes the horizontal distance between the two aircraft, ensuring that the minimum separation criteria are not violated.
- The new trajectory will prevent the predicted closest point of approach from falling below the required 5 nautical miles, thus resolving the conflict safely.

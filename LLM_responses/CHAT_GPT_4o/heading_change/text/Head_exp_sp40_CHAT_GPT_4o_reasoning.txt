To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 51 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 27.34 nautical miles
- **Altitude Difference**: 0 feet
- **TLOS**: 299.5 seconds
- **DCPA**: 35.57 meters (predicted in 366.5 seconds)

### Objective:
- Avoid loss of separation by ensuring horizontal distance remains above 5 nautical miles.

### Strategy:
1. **Change Heading of FLIGHT1**: Since FLIGHT1 is moving much slower than FLIGHT2, altering its heading will have a significant impact on the relative trajectory between the two aircraft.

2. **Calculate New Heading**: 
   - The azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is approximately 140 degrees. To increase the horizontal separation, FLIGHT1 should turn away from FLIGHT2.
   - A heading change to the left (counter-clockwise) will increase the separation more effectively given the current headings.

3. **Determine Optimal Heading Change**:
   - A heading change of approximately 30 degrees to the left (from 140 degrees to 110 degrees) will direct FLIGHT1 away from the path of FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation.

### Command:
- **FLIGHT1, turn left heading 110 degrees.**

### Rationale:
- **Increased Separation**: By turning left to a heading of 110 degrees, FLIGHT1 will move away from the direct path towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation.
- **Avoiding Conflict**: This heading change will ensure that the horizontal distance remains above the 5 nautical mile threshold, thus preventing a loss of separation.
- **Minimal Impact**: The change is minimal enough to not significantly disrupt FLIGHT1's overall flight path while effectively resolving the conflict.

This command should be monitored and adjusted as necessary based on real-time updates to ensure continued compliance with separation standards.

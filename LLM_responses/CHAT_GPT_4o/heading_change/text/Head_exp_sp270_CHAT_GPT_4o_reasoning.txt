To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 341 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 51.49 nautical miles
- **Altitude Difference**: 0 feet
- **TLOS**: 299.6 seconds
- **DCPA**: 125.75 meters (approximately 0.068 nautical miles)

### Objective:
To prevent loss of separation by adjusting the heading of FLIGHT1, ensuring that the horizontal distance remains greater than 5 nautical miles at all times.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Trajectory**: FLIGHT1 is on a heading of 140 degrees, and FLIGHT2 is on a heading of 320 degrees. The azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.92 degrees, indicating they are nearly on a direct collision course.

2. **Separation Criteria**: We need to adjust FLIGHT1's heading to increase the horizontal separation at the closest point of approach (CPA).

3. **Optimal Heading Change**:
   - To increase separation, FLIGHT1 should turn away from the current azimuthal direction to FLIGHT2 (139.92 degrees).
   - A right turn (clockwise) will increase the angle between the two aircraft, thus increasing the horizontal separation at CPA.

### Recommended Action:
- **Change FLIGHT1's Heading**: Turn FLIGHT1 to a new heading of approximately 180 degrees. This change will increase the angle between the two aircraft, moving FLIGHT1 away from the direct path to FLIGHT2.

### Rationale:
- **Increased Separation**: By turning to 180 degrees, FLIGHT1 will move away from the direct path to FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation at CPA.
- **Maintaining Safety**: This heading change ensures that the horizontal distance remains above the 5 nautical mile threshold, preventing a loss of separation.
- **Minimal Disruption**: A heading change to 180 degrees is a moderate adjustment that effectively resolves the conflict without significant deviation from FLIGHT1's original path.

By implementing this heading change, we ensure that the aircraft maintain safe separation and avoid a potential conflict.

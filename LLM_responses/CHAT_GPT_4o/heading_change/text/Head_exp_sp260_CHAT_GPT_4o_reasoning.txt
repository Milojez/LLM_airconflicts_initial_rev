To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

Given the current situation:
- Both aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 feet), so vertical separation is not an option.
- The horizontal distance is currently 50.47 nautical miles, but it is predicted to reduce to 120.82 meters (approximately 0.065 nautical miles) at the closest point of approach (DCPA).

To prevent the loss of separation, we need to adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to increase the horizontal distance at the time of closest approach. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Current Heading and QDR:**
   - FLIGHT1 is currently heading 140 degrees.
   - The azimuthal direction (QDR) from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.93 degrees, indicating that FLIGHT1 is almost directly heading towards FLIGHT2.

2. **Optimal Heading Change:**
   - To increase the horizontal separation, we should adjust FLIGHT1's heading away from FLIGHT2's current position.
   - Since FLIGHT1 is heading 140 degrees and the QDR is 139.93 degrees, a change in heading to the left (counter-clockwise) or right (clockwise) could be considered. However, turning right (clockwise) will likely increase the separation more effectively because it will move FLIGHT1 away from the direct path towards FLIGHT2.

3. **Suggested Heading Change:**
   - Change FLIGHT1's heading to approximately 160 degrees. This 20-degree right turn will direct FLIGHT1 away from the path towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation at the time of closest approach.

4. **Rationale:**
   - By changing the heading to 160 degrees, FLIGHT1 will move away from the direct line towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal distance at the closest point of approach.
   - This adjustment should be sufficient to maintain a horizontal separation greater than 5 nautical miles, thus preventing a loss of separation.

5. **Monitoring:**
   - After the heading change, continuously monitor the separation distance and adjust further if necessary to ensure compliance with separation standards.

By implementing this heading change, we aim to resolve the conflict while maintaining safe separation between the two aircraft.

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the required minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- Both aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 feet), so vertical separation is 0 feet.
- The horizontal distance is currently 36.91 nautical miles, but it is predicted to reduce to 64.77 meters (approximately 0.035 nautical miles) at the closest point of approach (DCPA).
- The azimuthal direction (QDR) from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.95 degrees.

### Objective:
- Adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to ensure that the horizontal distance remains greater than 5 nautical miles at all times.

### Strategy:
1. **Determine the Current Heading and Relative Position:**
   - FLIGHT1 is heading 140 degrees.
   - FLIGHT2 is heading 320 degrees.
   - The QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.95 degrees, indicating that FLIGHT2 is almost directly ahead of FLIGHT1.

2. **Calculate the Required Heading Change:**
   - To increase the horizontal separation, FLIGHT1 should alter its course to move away from the direct path to FLIGHT2.
   - Since FLIGHT2 is moving in the opposite direction (320 degrees), FLIGHT1 should turn to the right to increase separation.

3. **Implement the Heading Change:**
   - A right turn of approximately 30 degrees should be sufficient to increase the separation distance. This would change FLIGHT1's heading from 140 degrees to 170 degrees.
   - This adjustment will direct FLIGHT1 away from the path of FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation over time.

### Rationale:
- By changing FLIGHT1's heading to 170 degrees, we are effectively increasing the lateral distance between the two aircraft, ensuring that the horizontal separation remains above the 5 nautical mile threshold.
- This heading change is optimal because it minimizes the deviation from FLIGHT1's original path while effectively resolving the conflict.
- The adjustment is made early enough (with TLOS at 299.6 seconds) to ensure that the aircraft do not come within the minimum separation distance.

### Command:
- Instruct FLIGHT1: "FLIGHT1, turn right heading 170 degrees immediately."

This command should resolve the conflict by ensuring that the horizontal separation remains above the required minimum, thus maintaining safe separation between the two aircraft.

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 267 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 45.31 nautical miles
- **Altitude Difference**: 0 feet
- **TLOS**: 299.6 seconds
- **DCPA**: 97.45 meters (approximately 0.05 nautical miles)

### Objective:
- Avoid loss of separation by ensuring horizontal distance remains above 5 nautical miles.

### Strategy:
To prevent the predicted loss of separation, we can adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to increase the horizontal distance at the closest point of approach. Since the azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is approximately 139.93 degrees, FLIGHT1 is essentially heading towards FLIGHT2. We need to alter FLIGHT1's course to increase the separation.

### Recommended Action:
1. **Change FLIGHT1's Heading**: 
   - Increase FLIGHT1's heading to move away from the azimuthal direction towards FLIGHT2. 
   - A heading change to approximately 110 degrees would direct FLIGHT1 more to the east, increasing the lateral separation from FLIGHT2.

2. **Rationale**:
   - By changing the heading to 110 degrees, FLIGHT1 will move away from the direct path towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation at the closest point of approach.
   - This heading change should be sufficient to ensure that the horizontal distance remains above 5 nautical miles, thus avoiding a loss of separation.

3. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Continuously monitor the situation to ensure the new heading maintains the required separation.
   - Be prepared to make further adjustments if necessary, based on real-time data and aircraft response.

By implementing this heading change, we aim to resolve the conflict while maintaining safe separation standards.

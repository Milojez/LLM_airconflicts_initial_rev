To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

Given the current situation:
- Both aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 feet), so vertical separation is not an option.
- The horizontal distance is currently 52.51 nautical miles, but it is predicted to reduce to 130.76 meters (approximately 0.07 nautical miles) at the closest point of approach (DCPA).

To prevent the loss of separation, we need to adjust FLIGHT1's heading to increase the horizontal distance at the time of closest approach. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. **Current Heading and Conflict Direction:**
   - FLIGHT1 is currently heading 140 degrees.
   - The azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.92 degrees, indicating that FLIGHT2 is almost directly ahead of FLIGHT1.

2. **Optimal Heading Change:**
   - To increase separation, FLIGHT1 should alter its course to move away from the azimuthal direction of 139.92 degrees.
   - A heading change to the right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise) can be considered. However, since the azimuthal direction is very close to FLIGHT1's current heading, a right turn would be more effective in quickly increasing separation.

3. **Suggested Heading Change:**
   - Change FLIGHT1's heading to approximately 160 degrees. This 20-degree right turn will direct FLIGHT1 away from FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation at the time of closest approach.

4. **Rationale:**
   - By changing the heading to 160 degrees, FLIGHT1 will move away from the direct path towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal distance between the two aircraft.
   - This adjustment should be sufficient to maintain a horizontal separation of at least 5 nautical miles, thus preventing a loss of separation.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - Continuously monitor the situation to ensure the separation criteria are met.
   - Be prepared to make further adjustments if necessary, based on real-time data and aircraft response.

By implementing this heading change, we aim to resolve the conflict while maintaining safe separation standards.

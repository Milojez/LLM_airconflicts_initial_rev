To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 128 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 33.73 nautical miles
- **Current Vertical Distance**: 0 feet
- **TLOS**: 299.5 seconds
- **DCPA**: 54.11 meters (0.0292 nautical miles)

### Objective:
- Avoid loss of separation by ensuring horizontal distance remains above 5 nautical miles.

### Strategy:
1. **Change Heading of FLIGHT1**: Since FLIGHT2 is on a heading of 320 degrees, FLIGHT1 should adjust its heading to increase the horizontal separation. A heading change to the left (counter-clockwise) will increase the separation more effectively given the current azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is approximately 140 degrees.

2. **Calculate New Heading**: 
   - To maximize separation, FLIGHT1 should turn left to a heading that diverges from the current azimuthal direction to FLIGHT2. A heading change of approximately 30-40 degrees to the left should be sufficient to increase the horizontal separation.
   - New heading for FLIGHT1: 100-110 degrees.

3. **Rationale**:
   - By turning left, FLIGHT1 will move away from the direct path towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation.
   - This heading change should be sufficient to ensure that the horizontal distance remains above 5 nautical miles, thus preventing a loss of separation.

### Command:
- **FLIGHT1, turn left heading 105 degrees.**

This command should be issued promptly to ensure that the aircraft have enough time to adjust their paths and maintain safe separation. Continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure that the separation criteria are met and to make further adjustments if needed.

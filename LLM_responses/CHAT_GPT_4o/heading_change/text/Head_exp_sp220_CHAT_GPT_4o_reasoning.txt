To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to ensure that the minimum separation criteria are not violated. The criteria are:

- Vertical distance < 1000 feet
- Horizontal distance < 5 nautical miles

Currently, both aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 feet), so the vertical separation is 0 feet, which is already below the 1000 feet threshold. Therefore, we must focus on maintaining horizontal separation.

### Current Situation:
- Horizontal distance: 46.34 nautical miles
- DCPA: 101.95 meters (approximately 0.055 nautical miles)
- TLOS: 299.6 seconds
- Current heading of FLIGHT1: 140 degrees
- Current heading of FLIGHT2: 320 degrees

### Objective:
To prevent the horizontal distance from dropping below 5 nautical miles at the time of closest approach.

### Strategy:
1. **Change Heading of FLIGHT1**: Since FLIGHT1 is heading 140 degrees and FLIGHT2 is heading 320 degrees, they are on converging paths. We need to adjust FLIGHT1's heading to increase the horizontal separation at the closest point of approach.

2. **Optimal Heading Adjustment**: 
   - The azimuthal direction (QDR) from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.93 degrees, which is almost directly aligned with FLIGHT1's current heading. To increase separation, we should adjust FLIGHT1's heading to move away from this azimuth.
   - A heading change to the left (counter-clockwise) will increase the separation more effectively because it will move FLIGHT1 away from the direct path to FLIGHT2.

3. **Proposed Heading Change**:
   - Change FLIGHT1's heading from 140 degrees to approximately 120 degrees. This 20-degree left turn will help increase the horizontal separation by moving FLIGHT1 away from the direct path to FLIGHT2.

### Rationale:
- By changing FLIGHT1's heading to 120 degrees, we are increasing the angle between the two aircraft's paths, which will increase the horizontal separation at the closest point of approach.
- This adjustment should be sufficient to ensure that the horizontal distance remains above 5 nautical miles, thus preventing a loss of separation.
- The change is moderate enough to avoid drastic maneuvers, ensuring passenger comfort and maintaining operational efficiency.

### Command:
"FLIGHT1, turn left heading 120 degrees immediately to resolve traffic conflict with FLIGHT2."

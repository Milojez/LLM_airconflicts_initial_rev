To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 179 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 37.97 nautical miles
- **Altitude Difference**: 0 feet
- **Estimated Time to Loss of Separation (TLOS)**: 299.6 seconds
- **Predicted Closest Point of Approach (DCPA)**: 68.52 meters in 345.0 seconds

### Objective:
To adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to avoid loss of separation by increasing the horizontal distance at the closest point of approach to at least 5 nautical miles.

### Strategy:
1. **Determine the Relative Motion**: FLIGHT1 is moving southeast (heading 140 degrees), while FLIGHT2 is moving northwest (heading 320 degrees). The azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is approximately 140 degrees, indicating they are on a converging path.

2. **Adjust FLIGHT1's Heading**: To increase the horizontal separation, we can adjust FLIGHT1's heading to move it away from the path of FLIGHT2. Since FLIGHT2 is heading 320 degrees, we can turn FLIGHT1 more towards the east or northeast to increase the separation.

3. **Calculate the New Heading**: A heading change of approximately 30-40 degrees to the left (towards the east) should be sufficient to increase the separation. This would change FLIGHT1's heading from 140 degrees to approximately 100-110 degrees.

### Command:
- **Change FLIGHT1's heading to 110 degrees**.

### Rationale:
- **Increased Separation**: By turning FLIGHT1 to a heading of 110 degrees, it will move more towards the east, increasing the horizontal separation from FLIGHT2.
- **Avoiding Conflict**: This heading change will help ensure that the horizontal distance at the closest point of approach remains greater than 5 nautical miles, thus avoiding a loss of separation.
- **Minimal Disruption**: The heading change is moderate and should not significantly disrupt FLIGHT1's overall flight path.

By implementing this heading change, we can effectively resolve the conflict and maintain safe separation between the two aircraft.

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 77 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 29.47 nautical miles
- **Altitude Difference**: 0 feet
- **Estimated Time to Loss of Separation (TLOS)**: 299.5 seconds
- **Predicted Closest Point of Approach (DCPA)**: 41.33 meters

### Objective:
To adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to avoid the predicted loss of separation while maintaining safe separation distances.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Trajectory**: FLIGHT1 is on a heading of 140 degrees, moving towards FLIGHT2, which is on a heading of 320 degrees. The azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is approximately 140 degrees, indicating they are on converging paths.

2. **Separation Criteria**: We need to ensure that the horizontal distance remains greater than 5 nautical miles at all times.

3. **Optimal Heading Change**: To increase the horizontal separation, we can adjust FLIGHT1's heading to move away from the direct path towards FLIGHT2. Since the azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.96 degrees, a heading change to the left (counter-clockwise) would increase the separation.

### Recommended Action:
- **Change FLIGHT1's Heading**: Adjust FLIGHT1's heading from 140 degrees to approximately 110 degrees. This 30-degree left turn will direct FLIGHT1 away from the path of FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation.

### Rationale:
- **Increased Separation**: By turning left, FLIGHT1 will move away from the direct line towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal distance between the two aircraft.
- **Maintaining Safe Distance**: The new heading will help ensure that the horizontal distance remains above the 5 nautical mile threshold, preventing a loss of separation.
- **Minimal Disruption**: A 30-degree heading change is a moderate adjustment that should be manageable for the aircraft and will not significantly disrupt FLIGHT1's overall flight path.

By implementing this heading change, we can effectively resolve the conflict and maintain safe separation between the two aircraft.

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 by changing the heading of FLIGHT1, we need to ensure that the aircraft maintain the minimum separation criteria: a vertical distance of at least 1000 feet or a horizontal distance of at least 5 nautical miles.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 304 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 48.41 nautical miles
- **Altitude Difference**: 0 feet
- **TLOS**: 299.6 seconds
- **DCPA**: 111.21 meters (approximately 0.06 nautical miles)

### Objective:
- Avoid loss of separation by ensuring horizontal distance remains greater than 5 nautical miles.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Trajectories**: 
   - FLIGHT1 is heading southeast (140 degrees).
   - FLIGHT2 is heading northwest (320 degrees).
   - The azimuthal direction from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.93 degrees, indicating they are nearly on a direct collision course.

2. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
   - Since the aircraft are at the same altitude, we need to adjust the horizontal path of FLIGHT1 to increase the horizontal separation.
   - Changing the heading of FLIGHT1 to the left (counter-clockwise) will increase the angle between the two aircraft, thereby increasing the horizontal separation.

### Recommended Action:
- **Change FLIGHT1's Heading**: Adjust FLIGHT1's heading to 120 degrees.

### Rationale:
- **Heading Adjustment**: By changing FLIGHT1's heading from 140 degrees to 120 degrees, we increase the angle between the two aircraft, which will help increase the horizontal separation.
- **Separation Assurance**: This adjustment will ensure that the aircraft diverge more quickly, increasing the horizontal distance and preventing a loss of separation.
- **Minimal Disruption**: A 20-degree change is significant enough to alter the trajectory and avoid conflict while minimizing disruption to FLIGHT1's flight path.

This heading change should be monitored closely to ensure that the separation criteria are maintained and further adjustments can be made if necessary.

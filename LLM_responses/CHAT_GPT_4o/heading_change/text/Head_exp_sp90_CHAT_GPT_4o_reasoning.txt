To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to adjust the heading of FLIGHT1 to ensure that the minimum separation criteria are not violated. The criteria for loss of separation are a vertical distance of less than 1000 feet and a horizontal distance of less than 5 nautical miles. Currently, both aircraft are at the same altitude, so we must focus on maintaining horizontal separation.

### Current Situation:
- **FLIGHT1**: Heading 140 degrees, Ground Speed 115 knots
- **FLIGHT2**: Heading 320 degrees, Ground Speed 217 knots
- **Current Horizontal Distance**: 32.67 nautical miles
- **Predicted DCPA**: 50.76 meters (which is less than 5 nautical miles)

### Objective:
- Increase the horizontal separation at the closest point of approach (CPA) to be greater than 5 nautical miles.

### Strategy:
To increase the horizontal separation, we can adjust the heading of FLIGHT1. Since FLIGHT2 is on a heading of 320 degrees, moving FLIGHT1 away from the direction of FLIGHT2 will increase the separation.

### Calculation:
1. **Current QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2**: 139.95 degrees
2. **FLIGHT1's Current Heading**: 140 degrees

To increase separation, we should adjust FLIGHT1's heading to move away from the QDR. A heading change to the left (counter-clockwise) will increase the separation.

### Recommended Heading Change:
- **New Heading for FLIGHT1**: 120 degrees

### Rationale:
- By changing FLIGHT1's heading to 120 degrees, we are effectively moving it away from the direct path towards FLIGHT2, increasing the horizontal separation at the CPA.
- This heading change is significant enough to ensure that the DCPA exceeds 5 nautical miles, thus preventing a loss of separation.
- The change is moderate and should be manageable for the aircraft to execute without causing undue stress or requiring excessive maneuvering.

### Command:
"FLIGHT1, turn left heading 120 degrees."

This command should be issued promptly to ensure that the aircraft has sufficient time to adjust its path and avoid the predicted conflict.

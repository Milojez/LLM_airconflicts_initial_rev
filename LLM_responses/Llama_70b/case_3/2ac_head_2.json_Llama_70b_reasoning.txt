**Conflict Resolution**

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to analyze the situation and determine the most effective way to maintain safe separation.

**Current Situation:**

* FLIGHT1 (B737) is at 16800 feet, heading 140 degrees, and ground speed 292 knots.
* FLIGHT2 (B777) is at 18298 feet, heading 320 degrees, and ground speed 227 knots.
* Horizontal distance: 48.23 nautical miles.
* Altitude difference: 1498.4 feet.
* Azimuthal direction (QDR) from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2: 139.93 degrees.
* Estimated time to loss of separation (TLOS): 299.6 seconds.
* Predicted closest point of approach (DCPA): 110.39 meters, expected to occur in 334.3 seconds.

**Analysis:**

* The altitude difference between the two aircraft is significant (1498.4 feet), but the horizontal distance is relatively large (48.23 nautical miles).
* The QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.93 degrees, which is close to FLIGHT1's heading (140 degrees). This suggests that FLIGHT1 is flying almost directly towards FLIGHT2.
* The predicted DCPA is 110.39 meters, which is very close to the minimum separation criteria.

**Recommended Actions:**

To maintain safe separation, we recommend the following actions:

1. **FLIGHT1: Turn right heading 160 degrees**. This will increase the horizontal distance between the two aircraft and reduce the likelihood of a collision.
2. **FLIGHT2: Descend to 17000 feet**. This will increase the altitude difference between the two aircraft and provide a larger buffer zone.
3. **FLIGHT1: Reduce ground speed to 250 knots**. This will reduce the rate of closure between the two aircraft and provide more time for the turn to take effect.

**Rationale:**

* Turning FLIGHT1 right will increase the horizontal distance and reduce the likelihood of a collision.
* Descending FLIGHT2 will increase the altitude difference and provide a larger buffer zone.
* Reducing FLIGHT1's ground speed will reduce the rate of closure and provide more time for the turn to take effect.

**Clearance:**

FLIGHT1, turn right heading 160 degrees, reduce ground speed to 250 knots. FLIGHT2, descend to 17000 feet. Report altitude and heading changes.

**Monitoring:**

Closely monitor the situation and adjust clearances as necessary to ensure safe separation is maintained.

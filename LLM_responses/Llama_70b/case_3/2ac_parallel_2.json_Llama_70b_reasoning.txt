**Conflict Resolution**

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 (B747) and FLIGHT2 (A330), we need to analyze the situation and determine the most effective way to maintain safe separation.

**Current Situation:**

* FLIGHT1 (B747) is at 22,200 feet, heading 216 degrees, ground speed 233 knots.
* FLIGHT2 (A330) is at 24,196 feet, heading 215 degrees, ground speed 365 knots.
* Current horizontal distance: 12.30 nautical miles.
* Altitude difference: 1,996.8 feet.
* Estimated time to loss of separation (TLOS): 299.3 seconds.
* Predicted closest point of approach (DCPA): 6.68 meters in 335.6 seconds.

**Analysis:**

* The aircraft are on similar headings, which increases the risk of collision.
* The altitude difference is significant, but FLIGHT2 is descending at 200 feet/min, which may reduce the altitude difference over time.
* The ground speed of FLIGHT2 is much higher than FLIGHT1, which may cause FLIGHT2 to close in on FLIGHT1 quickly.

**Recommended Actions:**

To maintain safe separation, we recommend the following actions:

1. **FLIGHT2 (A330):** Climb to 25,000 feet at a rate of 500 feet/min. This will increase the altitude difference and reduce the risk of collision.
2. **FLIGHT2 (A330):** Turn right heading 240 degrees. This will increase the horizontal distance between the two aircraft and reduce the risk of collision.
3. **FLIGHT1 (B747):** Maintain current heading and altitude. No changes are recommended for FLIGHT1 at this time.

**Rationale:**

* Climbing FLIGHT2 will increase the altitude difference and reduce the risk of collision.
* Turning FLIGHT2 right will increase the horizontal distance between the two aircraft and reduce the risk of collision.
* Maintaining FLIGHT1's current heading and altitude will minimize disruptions to its flight plan.

**Monitoring:**

* Continuously monitor the situation and adjust the recommended actions as necessary to ensure safe separation.
* Recalculate the TLOS and DCPA after implementing the recommended actions to ensure that the conflict is resolved.

By implementing these actions, we can maintain safe separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 and prevent a potential collision.

To determine if there will be a loss of separation, we need to calculate the current distance between the two aircraft and then predict their future positions to see if they will meet the conditions for loss of separation.

### Step 1: Convert Coordinates to a Common Unit

First, let's convert the coordinates into a more manageable format. The y and x coordinates are given in meters. We'll keep them in meters for now since we're working with distances that don't require conversion to other units for the initial assessment.

### Step 2: Calculate Current Distance Between Aircraft

To find the current distance between the two aircraft, we use the distance formula:
\[d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\]

Given:
- \(x_1 = 377813.17429230036\) meters
- \(y_1 = 3846375.103096159\) meters
- \(x_2 = 397988.16415116284\) meters
- \(y_2 = 3926444.887643315\) meters

\[d = \sqrt{(397988.16415116284 - 377813.17429230036)^2 + (3926444.887643315 - 3846375.103096159)^2}\]
\[d = \sqrt{(20075.0)^2 + (80069.784547156)^2}\]
\[d = \sqrt{401400625 + 6411348923.141}\]
\[d = \sqrt{6811749548.141}\]
\[d \approx 8265.35 \, \text{meters}\]

To convert meters to nautical miles, we use the conversion factor: \(1 \, \text{nautical mile} = 1852 \, \text{meters}\).

\[d \approx \frac{8265.35}{1852} \approx 4.47 \, \text{nautical miles}\]

### Step 3: Assess Vertical Separation

Both aircraft are flying at 20800 feet. Since their altitudes are the same, the vertical distance between them is 0 feet, which is less than the 1000 feet threshold for loss of separation.

### Step 4: Predict Future Positions

Given the ground speeds and headings, we need to predict if the aircraft will come within 5 nautical miles of each other horizontally and maintain a vertical distance of less than 1000 feet.

- FLIGHT1: Speed = 268 knots, Heading = 71 degrees
- FLIGHT2: Speed = 392 knots, Heading = 161 degrees

To simplify, let's consider their movement in the x-y plane. The relative speed and direction between the two aircraft will determine if they close the distance.

### Step 5: Determine Relative Speed and Direction

The relative speed between two aircraft can be found using the cosine law, but for simplicity, let's break down their movements into components and then find the relative movement.

However, given the complexity of predicting exact future positions without specific time frames or more detailed movement predictions, and considering the aircraft are already close to the horizontal separation threshold and at the same altitude, we must consider the possibility of loss of separation.

### Step 6: Conclusion on Loss of Separation

Given the current distance is approximately 4.47 nautical miles and both aircraft are at the same altitude, there is a risk of loss of separation if their trajectories bring them closer together. The exact time of potential loss of separation would depend on their exact flight paths, which can be influenced by their headings and speeds.

### Necessary Commands to Maintain Safe Separation

To maintain safe separation, one or both of the aircraft need to be directed to change their flight path. Possible commands could include:

1. **Altitude Adjustment**: One aircraft could be instructed to climb or descend to increase the vertical separation.
2. **Heading Change**: Changing the heading of one or both aircraft to alter their trajectory and increase the horizontal distance.
3. **Speed Modification**: Adjusting the speed of one or both aircraft to change the rate at which they are closing the distance.

Given the information, a possible command could be to instruct FLIGHT1 to turn to a heading that increases the horizontal distance between the two aircraft, or to instruct FLIGHT2 to climb or descend to increase the vertical separation. The exact command would depend on the current air traffic situation, other aircraft in the vicinity, and the capabilities of the aircraft involved.

For example:
- "FLIGHT1, turn right heading 090 degrees to increase separation with FLIGHT2."
- "FLIGHT2, climb and maintain 21000 feet to increase vertical separation with FLIGHT1."

These commands are speculative and based on the provided data. Actual commands would require a more detailed analysis of the air traffic situation and consideration of standard air traffic control procedures and protocols.

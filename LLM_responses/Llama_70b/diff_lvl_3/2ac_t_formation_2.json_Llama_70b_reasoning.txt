**Conflict Resolution**

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to analyze the situation and determine the most effective way to maintain safe separation. Based on the provided data, here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Situation**:
	* FLIGHT1 (A330) is at 20,200 feet, heading 071°, and ground speed 266 knots.
	* FLIGHT2 (A320) is at 22,290 feet, heading 161°, and ground speed 381 knots.
	* Horizontal distance: 24.28 nautical miles.
	* Altitude difference: 2,091.3 feet.
	* Azimuthal direction (QDR) from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2: 015.98°.
2. **Conflict Analysis**:
	* The estimated time to loss of separation (TLOS) is 149.3 seconds, indicating a potential violation of minimum separation criteria.
	* The predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) is 56.85 meters, expected to occur in 188.0 seconds.
3. **Resolution Options**:
	* **Altitude Adjustment**: FLIGHT2 is descending at -550 feet/min. To increase the altitude difference, we could instruct FLIGHT2 to level off or climb. However, this might not be sufficient to resolve the conflict, given the relatively small altitude difference.
	* **Heading Change**: FLIGHT1 is heading 071°, while FLIGHT2 is heading 161°. A heading change for either aircraft could help increase the horizontal distance. However, FLIGHT2's high ground speed (381 knots) might make it more challenging to achieve a significant change in heading.
	* **Speed Modification**: Reducing FLIGHT2's ground speed could help decrease the rate of closure and increase the time available to resolve the conflict.

**Recommended Commands**:

To maintain safe separation, we recommend the following commands:

1. **FLIGHT2**: Reduce ground speed to 280 knots. This will decrease the rate of closure and provide more time to resolve the conflict.
2. **FLIGHT2**: Level off at current altitude (22,290 feet). This will prevent further descent and help maintain a safe altitude difference.

**Rationale**:

* Reducing FLIGHT2's ground speed will decrease the rate of closure, providing more time to resolve the conflict.
* Leveling off FLIGHT2's altitude will prevent further descent and help maintain a safe altitude difference.
* These commands should be sufficient to maintain safe separation, given the relatively small altitude difference and the predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) of 56.85 meters.

**Monitoring and Follow-up**:

After issuing these commands, we will closely monitor the situation and adjust as necessary to ensure safe separation is maintained. If the conflict persists or worsens, we may need to consider additional commands, such as a heading change or further altitude adjustments.

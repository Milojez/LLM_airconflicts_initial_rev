**Conflict Resolution**

To resolve the conflict between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to analyze the situation and determine the most effective way to maintain safe separation.

**Current Situation:**

* Both aircraft are flying at the same altitude (20800 feet) with no vertical separation.
* The horizontal distance between them is 44.54 nautical miles, which is currently not a concern.
* The estimated time to loss of separation (TLOS) is 299.5 seconds, indicating that the aircraft will violate the minimum separation criteria if no action is taken.
* The predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) is 193.24 meters, which is very close and indicates a high risk of collision.

**Analysis:**

* Since both aircraft are flying at the same altitude, a vertical separation is not possible.
* A heading change for one or both aircraft could be effective in increasing the horizontal distance between them.
* A speed modification could also be considered, but it may not be enough to prevent the loss of separation.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Heading Change:** Issue a heading change command to FLIGHT1 to turn right by 20-30 degrees (e.g., new heading: 91-101 degrees). This will increase the horizontal distance between the two aircraft and reduce the risk of collision.
2. **Speed Modification:** Consider issuing a speed reduction command to FLIGHT2 to reduce its ground speed by 20-30 knots (e.g., new speed: 362-372 knots). This will reduce the closure rate between the two aircraft and provide more time for the heading change to take effect.

**Example Commands:**

* "FLIGHT1, turn right heading 095 degrees, acknowledge."
* "FLIGHT2, reduce speed to 370 knots, acknowledge."

**Monitoring:**

* Closely monitor the situation and adjust the commands as necessary to ensure that the minimum separation criteria are maintained.
* Recalculate the TLOS and DCPA after issuing the commands to ensure that the conflict is resolved.

By issuing these commands, we can increase the horizontal distance between the two aircraft, reduce the risk of collision, and maintain safe separation.

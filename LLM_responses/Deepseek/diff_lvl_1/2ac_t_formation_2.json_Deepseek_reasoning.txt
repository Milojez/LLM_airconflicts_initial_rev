To determine if there will be a loss of separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, we need to calculate their current distance (both horizontally and vertically) and then predict their future positions based on their current speeds, headings, and vertical rates.

### Step 1: Calculate Current Horizontal Distance

First, we calculate the horizontal distance between the two aircraft using their latitudes and longitudes. The formula to calculate the distance between two points on the Earth's surface given their longitudes and latitudes is:

\[d = \sqrt{(lat_2 - lat_1)^2 + (lon_2 - lon_1)^2}\]

However, for more accurate calculations over long distances, we should use the Haversine formula. But given the relatively close proximity of these aircraft, the simplified formula will suffice for an initial estimation.

Given:
- \(lat_1 = -55.51339915996272\)
- \(lon_1 = 13.064955990620039\)
- \(lat_2 = -55.12472416548402\)
- \(lon_2 = 13.260548768995166\)

\[d = \sqrt{(-55.12472416548402 + 55.51339915996272)^2 + (13.260548768995166 - 13.064955990620039)^2}\]
\[d = \sqrt{(0.3886749944787)^2 + (0.195592778375127)^2}\]
\[d = \sqrt{0.151 + 0.0382}\]
\[d = \sqrt{0.1892}\]
\[d \approx 0.435 \, \text{degrees}\]

To convert degrees to nautical miles, we use the fact that 1 degree of latitude or longitude at the equator is approximately equal to 60 nautical miles. However, since we are not at the equator, and the conversion depends on the latitude, we'll use an approximate conversion factor for the latitude in question:

At latitude -55 degrees, 1 degree of latitude is approximately 59.6 nautical miles, and 1 degree of longitude is approximately 43.8 nautical miles (due to the Earth's slightly ellipsoidal shape). For simplicity, we'll use these values directly for conversion, though ideally, we'd convert the difference in latitude and longitude separately and then apply the conversion factors.

\[d \approx 0.435 \, \text{degrees} \times 59.6 \, \text{nautical miles/degree} \approx 25.9 \, \text{nautical miles}\]

However, this calculation does not accurately reflect the horizontal distance because it does not correctly account for the difference in latitude and longitude separately and apply the appropriate conversion factors for each. Let's correct this approach by using the Haversine formula for a more precise calculation:

### Correct Approach Using Haversine Formula

The Haversine formula is:
\[d = 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{lat_2 - lat_1}{2}\right) + \cos(lat_1) \cos(lat_2) \sin^2\left(\frac{lon_2 - lon_1}{2}\right)}\right) \times R\]

Where \(R\) is the Earth's radius, approximately 6371 kilometers. We convert this to nautical miles by remembering that 1 nautical mile = 1.852 kilometers.

\[R \approx 6371 \, \text{km} \times \frac{1 \, \text{nautical mile}}{1.852 \, \text{km}} \approx 3440 \, \text{nautical miles}\]

Given \(lat_1 = -55.51339915996272\), \(lon_1 = 13.064955990620039\), \(lat_2 = -55.12472416548402\), \(lon_2 = 13.260548768995166\), let's calculate \(d\) in nautical miles:

\[d = 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{-55.12472416548402 - (-55.51339915996272)}{2}\right) + \cos(-55.51339915996272) \cos(-55.12472416548402) \sin^2\left(\frac{13.260548768995166 - 13.064955990620039}{2}\right)}\right) \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{0.3886749944787}{2}\right) + \cos(-55.51339915996272) \cos(-55.12472416548402) \sin^2\left(\frac{0.195592778375127}{2}\right)}\right) \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2(0.19433749723935) + \cos(-55.51339915996272) \cos(-55.12472416548402) \sin^2(0.0977963891875635)}\right) \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{0.0377 + 0.5722 \times 0.5735 \times 0.0095}\right) \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{0.0377 + 0.0031}\right) \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{0.0408}\right) \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin(0.202) \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 2 \times 0.202 \times \frac{180}{\pi} \times 3440 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\]

\[d \approx 0.404 \times 3440\]

\[d \approx 1391.36 \, \text{nautical miles}\]

This calculation appears to have been incorrectly simplified. The correct approach to calculate the distance using the Haversine formula involves more precise trigonometric calculations, typically resulting in a value that, when correctly calculated, should be much smaller than the result shown above, given the initial latitudes and longitudes provided.

### Simplified Calculation for Illustration

For the purpose of this explanation and to correct the calculation approach, let's simplify the process by directly calculating the distance using a more straightforward method, acknowledging that the precise Haversine formula calculation was not correctly executed above.

Given the complexity of accurately calculating distances using latitude and longitude without computational tools, let's focus on the conceptual approach to determining potential loss of separation and the actions to prevent it.

### Step 2: Calculate Current Vertical Distance

The vertical distance is simply the difference in their altitudes:
\[|20200 - 22290| = 2090 \, \text{feet}\]

### Step 3: Predict Future Positions

To predict if there will be a loss of separation, we need to consider their ground speeds, headings, and vertical rates.

- FLIGHT1 is flying at 266 knots, heading 71 degrees, with a vertical rate of 0 feet/min.
- FLIGHT2 is flying at 381 knots, heading 161 degrees, with a vertical rate of -550 feet/min.

Given their current positions, speeds, and directions, we would calculate their future positions at regular intervals to see if they will come within 5 nautical miles of each other horizontally and 1000 feet vertically.

### Step 4: Determine Potential Loss of Separation

Without precise calculations of their future positions based on their speeds and headings, we cannot directly determine if they will lose separation. However, we can discuss the general approach to preventing loss of separation:

1. **Altitude Adjustments**: If two aircraft are predicted to be within 1000 feet of each other vertically, consider adjusting the altitude of one or both aircraft.
2. **Heading Changes**: Altering the heading of one or both aircraft can increase the horizontal distance between them.
3. **Speed Modifications**: Increasing or decreasing the speed of one aircraft can also affect the distance between them.

### Commands to Maintain Safe Separation

Based on the initial data, without precise future position calculations, potential commands could include:

- **Altitude Adjustment**: "FLIGHT2, descend and maintain 20000 feet."
- **Heading Change**: "FLIGHT1, turn right heading 090 degrees."
- **Speed Modification**: "FLIGHT2, reduce speed to 300 knots."

These commands are speculative and would depend on the actual predicted trajectories of the aircraft. In real-world scenarios, air traffic controllers use sophisticated software and radar data to make these determinations and issue precise instructions to maintain safe separation.

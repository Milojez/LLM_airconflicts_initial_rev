To determine if there will be a loss of separation, we need to calculate the current distance between the two aircraft and then predict their future positions based on their current speeds, headings, and vertical rates.

### Step 1: Calculate Current Distance Between Aircraft

First, we calculate the horizontal distance between the two aircraft using their latitude and longitude coordinates. We'll use the Haversine formula for this purpose, which gives the distance between two points on a sphere (such as the Earth) given their longitudes and latitudes.

Given:
- Latitude and longitude of FLIGHT1: (25.095763879115907, -170.9951399602514)
- Latitude and longitude of FLIGHT2: (24.48112377126363, -170.42562592063655)

The Haversine formula is:
\[d = 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2) \sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)}\right) \times R\]

where:
- \(d\) is the distance between the two points,
- \(\phi_1\) and \(\phi_2\) are the latitudes of the two points in radians,
- \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) are the longitudes of the two points in radians,
- \(R\) is the radius of the Earth, approximately 6371 kilometers.

Let's convert the given coordinates to radians and calculate the distance:
- \(\phi_1 = 25.095763879115907 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\),
- \(\phi_2 = 24.48112377126363 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\),
- \(\lambda_1 = -170.9951399602514 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\),
- \(\lambda_2 = -170.42562592063655 \times \frac{\pi}{180}\).

\[d = 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{0.4399 - 0.4265}{2}\right) + \cos(0.4399) \cos(0.4265) \sin^2\left(\frac{-2.9835 - (-2.9763)}{2}\right)}\right) \times 6371\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2(0.0067) + \cos(0.4399) \cos(0.4265) \sin^2(-0.0036)}\right) \times 6371\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{0.000045 + 0.9999 \times 0.9998 \times 0.00000013}\right) \times 6371\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{0.000045 + 0.00000013}\right) \times 6371\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin\left(\sqrt{0.00004513}\right) \times 6371\]

\[d \approx 2 \times \arcsin(0.0067) \times 6371\]

\[d \approx 2 \times 0.0067 \times 6371\]

\[d \approx 85.3 \, \text{km}\]

To convert kilometers to nautical miles, we use the conversion factor: 1 km = 0.5399568034557235 nautical miles.

\[d \approx 85.3 \times 0.5399568034557235\]

\[d \approx 46.1 \, \text{nautical miles}\]

The vertical distance is the absolute difference between their altitudes:
\[|16800 - 18298| = 1498 \, \text{feet}\]

### Step 2: Predict Future Positions

Given the current speeds, headings, and vertical rates, we can predict the future positions of the aircraft. However, without specific time frames or more detailed information on how their speeds or headings might change, we'll focus on the current situation and the immediate need for separation.

### Step 3: Determine Loss of Separation

Based on the calculations:
- Horizontal distance is approximately 46.1 nautical miles, which is greater than 5 nautical miles.
- Vertical distance is 1498 feet, which is less than 1000 feet.

However, since both conditions (horizontal distance < 5 nautical miles and vertical distance < 1000 feet) must be met simultaneously for a loss of separation, and the horizontal distance is significantly greater than 5 nautical miles, there is currently no loss of separation.

### Step 4: Commands to Maintain Safe Separation

Given the current situation, no immediate commands are necessary to maintain safe separation since the aircraft are not predicted to violate the separation criteria based on the provided data. However, it's essential to continue monitoring their positions and adjust as necessary to prevent any potential future loss of separation.

For future reference or in case the situation changes, potential commands could include:
- Altitude adjustments: If the vertical distance were to decrease below 1000 feet and the horizontal distance were to decrease below 5 nautical miles, adjusting the altitude of one or both aircraft could help maintain separation.
- Heading changes: Altering the heading of one or both aircraft could increase the horizontal distance between them.
- Speed modifications: Adjusting the speed of one or both aircraft could also affect their relative positions and help maintain safe separation.

Continuous monitoring and proactive adjustments based on the aircraft's trajectories and separation standards are crucial for maintaining safe distances between aircraft.

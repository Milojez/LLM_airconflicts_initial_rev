To determine if there will be a loss of separation between FLIGHT1 (B747) and FLIGHT2 (A330), we need to calculate their current distance and project their future positions based on their speeds and headings.

### Step 1: Convert Coordinates to a Common Reference for Easier Calculation

Given that both aircraft are flying at the same altitude (25200 feet), we only need to consider their horizontal distances for now. The vertical distance is 0 since they are at the same altitude.

### Step 2: Calculate Current Horizontal Distance

First, convert the coordinates into a more manageable format. The coordinates given are in meters, so we'll keep them in meters for simplicity. 

The distance \(d\) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) can be calculated using the distance formula:
\[d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\]

For FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2:
- \(x_1 = 515161.17584979517\) meters
- \(y_1 = 2536816.8443335756\) meters
- \(x_2 = 535663.0858283433\) meters
- \(y_2 = 2565002.2206728975\) meters

\[d = \sqrt{(535663.0858283433 - 515161.17584979517)^2 + (2565002.2206728975 - 2536816.8443335756)^2}\]
\[d = \sqrt{(20401.90997854813)^2 + (28185.376339322)^2}\]
\[d = \sqrt{41555119.192 + 79455169.191}\]
\[d = \sqrt{121010288.383}\]
\[d \approx 10994.43 \, \text{meters}\]

To convert meters to nautical miles, remember that \(1 \, \text{nautical mile} = 1852 \, \text{meters}\).
\[d \approx \frac{10994.43}{1852} \approx 5.93 \, \text{nautical miles}\]

### Step 3: Determine Relative Speed and Projected Time to Loss of Separation

Both aircraft are flying at the same heading (216 degrees), which means they are flying in the same direction. 

- Speed of FLIGHT1: 245 knots
- Speed of FLIGHT2: 412 knots

Since they are flying in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds:
\[Relative \, Speed = 412 - 245 = 167 \, \text{knots}\]

To find the time it would take for them to be 5 nautical miles apart (assuming they maintain their current speeds and headings), we first need to establish the distance they need to close. However, since they are already more than 5 nautical miles apart and moving in the same direction, we should instead consider if their current separation will decrease.

Given their current separation is approximately 5.93 nautical miles, and they are moving in the same direction, the critical factor is their relative speed and the fact that they are at the same altitude.

### Step 4: Assessing the Situation

Since both aircraft are at the same altitude and flying in the same direction, the primary concern is their horizontal separation decreasing below 5 nautical miles. Given their relative speed and current distance, we calculate the time it would take for the faster aircraft (FLIGHT2) to close the gap to 5 nautical miles.

First, convert the relative speed to nautical miles per minute:
\[167 \, \text{knots} = \frac{167}{60} \, \text{nautical miles per minute}\]
\[= 2.7833 \, \text{nautical miles per minute}\]

The distance to close is \(5.93 - 5 = 0.93\) nautical miles.

\[Time = \frac{Distance}{Speed} = \frac{0.93}{2.7833} \approx 0.335 \, \text{minutes}\]

This calculation, however, assumes a need to close a gap, which isn't directly applicable since we're assessing if they'll get too close. The actual concern is if their current separation will decrease to less than 5 nautical miles due to their relative speeds.

Given they are moving in the same direction and FLIGHT2 is faster, it will eventually overtake FLIGHT1, potentially reducing their horizontal separation. However, the initial calculation of time to close the gap was based on a misunderstanding of the requirement to calculate the time to reach a separation of less than 5 nautical miles from their current positions.

### Step 5: Correct Approach to Determine Time to Loss of Separation

To correctly assess if and when they might reach a loss of separation, consider their relative motion. Since they're flying in the same direction, the faster aircraft (FLIGHT2) will close in on the slower one (FLIGHT1). The critical factor is the time it takes for FLIGHT2 to get within 5 nautical miles of FLIGHT1.

Given the current separation is about 5.93 nautical miles, and considering their relative speed (167 knots), we should calculate how long it takes for FLIGHT2 to close this gap to 5 nautical miles or less.

However, the error in the initial steps was in calculating the time to close a specific gap without properly accounting for their current separation and relative motion. The correct approach involves recognizing that since they are already close to the 5 nautical mile threshold and moving in the same direction, the faster aircraft will close the gap, but the calculation provided does not directly apply to determining the exact time of loss of separation without considering their positions and velocities over time.

### Conclusion

Given the complexities and the error in the direct calculation approach for the specific scenario of determining the time to loss of separation based on their relative speeds and directions, a more detailed analysis considering their flight paths and continuous updating of their positions would be necessary for precise calculations.

For air traffic control purposes, the focus should be on ensuring that the aircraft do not violate the separation standards. Given that both aircraft are currently at the same altitude and their horizontal separation is close to the threshold, issuing commands to adjust their speeds or altitudes could be necessary to maintain safe separation.

### Recommendations

1. **Speed Adjustment**: Consider instructing FLIGHT2 to reduce its speed to match or come closer to FLIGHT1's speed, thereby reducing the rate at which it closes the gap.
2. **Altitude Adjustment**: If possible, consider instructing one of the aircraft to change altitude, which would immediately resolve any potential loss of separation issue due to vertical separation.
3. **Heading Change**: A heading change for one or both aircraft could also be considered to increase their horizontal separation.

These commands would depend on the overall traffic situation, the availability of alternative routes or altitudes, and the fuel and time implications for the flights involved. The primary goal is to ensure safe separation is maintained at all times.

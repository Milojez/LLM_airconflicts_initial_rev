Okay, here is the analysis and command to resolve the conflict:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict Nature:** The core issue is a head-on conflict. FLIGHT1 (heading 140°) and FLIGHT2 (heading 320°) are on reciprocal tracks (140° + 180° = 320°).
2.  **Altitude:** Both aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 ft), meaning vertical separation is 0 ft. This is less than the 1000 ft minimum vertical separation required.
3.  **Separation Criteria:** Loss of separation will occur if the horizontal distance drops below 5 NM *while* the vertical separation is less than 1000 ft. Since vertical separation is already 0 ft, the *only* way to prevent LOS is to ensure horizontal separation remains above 5 NM.
4.  **Prediction:** The system predicts a very close CPA (68.52 meters, essentially zero horizontal separation) occurring in about 345 seconds, with the 5 NM threshold being breached earlier (TLOS 299.6 seconds). This confirms the need for immediate action.
5.  **Constraint:** The solution must *only* involve changing the heading of FLIGHT1.
6.  **Optimality:** An optimal solution provides sufficient separation with minimum deviation from the original flight path. Given the head-on geometry, a turn is necessary. A standard ATC turn for conflict resolution is often around 30 degrees. Turning right is a common convention in head-on situations (though not strictly mandatory under radar control) and moves FLIGHT1 away from the bearing of FLIGHT2 (QDR 139.94° is very close to FLIGHT1's nose).

**Action:**

A turn of 30 degrees to the right for FLIGHT1 will change its heading from 140° to 170°. This immediately breaks the head-on alignment and creates divergence between the flight paths, ensuring the horizontal separation will increase significantly from the predicted CPA of 68.5m and remain well above the 5 NM minimum.

**Command:**

"**FLIGHT1, turn right heading 170 degrees, traffic avoidance.**"

**Rationale:**

*   **Reason:** To resolve a predicted loss of separation with FLIGHT2.
*   **Conflict:** You are currently on a converging, reciprocal course with FLIGHT2 at the same altitude (16200 ft). The predicted closest point of approach is significantly less than the required 5 NM minimum horizontal separation.
*   **Action:** Turning FLIGHT1 right by 30 degrees (from 140° to 170°) provides immediate lateral divergence from FLIGHT2's track.
*   **Optimality:** This is a standard maneuver magnitude that effectively resolves the conflict by ensuring horizontal separation remains well above 5 NM, while minimizing deviation from the original route compared to a larger turn. It adheres to the constraint of only maneuvering FLIGHT1.

Okay, here is the analysis and command to resolve the conflict:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict Identification:** FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are at the same altitude (16200 ft), meaning vertical separation is 0 ft. This immediately satisfies one condition for Loss of Separation (< 1000 ft vertical).
2.  **Convergence:** Their headings (FLIGHT1: 140°, FLIGHT2: 320°) are nearly reciprocal (180° difference), indicating a head-on convergence course. The QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 (139.95°) being almost identical to FLIGHT1's heading confirms this direct convergence.
3.  **Predicted Outcome:** Without intervention, they are predicted to pass extremely close horizontally (DCPA: 61.12 meters), well within the 5 NM minimum horizontal separation required when vertical separation is less than 1000 ft. The TLOS confirms a breach of the 5 NM limit is imminent (within ~5 minutes).
4.  **Resolution Constraint:** Only FLIGHT1's heading can be changed.
5.  **Optimal Solution Requirement:** The turn should be sufficient to guarantee separation (> 5 NM horizontally) but ideally minimize deviation from FLIGHT1's original course. A standard ATC turn increment (e.g., 30 degrees) is usually preferred for predictability and effectiveness. Turning right is often standard procedure in head-on situations, but either direction would work geometrically.

**Decision:**

A turn is required for FLIGHT1 to diverge from FLIGHT2's track. Given the head-on nature and very small predicted DCPA, a turn of at least 30 degrees is prudent to ensure separation is maintained well above the 5 NM minimum. A right turn is chosen as a standard resolution for head-on conflicts.

*   Current Heading FLIGHT1: 140°
*   Chosen Turn: Right 30°
*   New Heading FLIGHT1: 140° + 30° = 170°

**Command:**

"**FLIGHT1, turn right heading one seven zero.**"

**Rationale:**

"FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are converging head-on at the same altitude, 16200 feet. The predicted closest point of approach is significantly less than the required 5 nautical miles horizontal separation. Instructing FLIGHT1 to turn right 30 degrees to a heading of 170 degrees provides immediate horizontal divergence from FLIGHT2's track (heading 320 degrees). This maneuver is sufficient to ensure the horizontal separation will remain safely above the 5 nautical mile minimum throughout the encounter, resolving the predicted loss of separation while adhering to the constraint of only modifying FLIGHT1's heading."

Okay, analyzing the situation:

1.  **Conflict Type:** The aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 ft) with 0 ft vertical separation. Their headings (140° and 320°) are nearly reciprocal (180° difference), indicating a head-on convergence course. The QDR (139.92°) confirms FLIGHT2 is almost directly ahead of FLIGHT1.
2.  **Urgency:** TLOS is ~5 minutes (299.7s), but the predicted DCPA is extremely small (141m / ~0.076 NM), well below the 5 NM minimum horizontal separation required at the same altitude. Action is required.
3.  **Constraint:** Only FLIGHT1's heading can be changed.
4.  **Objective:** Increase the horizontal separation at the closest point of approach (CPA) to be greater than 5 NM.
5.  **Optimal Solution:** In a head-on scenario, turning either left or right will increase separation. A turn to the right is often standard procedure. An "optimal" turn in this context usually means the minimum deviation necessary to ensure separation, while being decisive enough to clearly resolve the conflict quickly. A standard vectoring turn is often 30 degrees.

**Decision:** A turn to the right for FLIGHT1 is the preferred standard action. A 30-degree turn should provide sufficient divergence given the current geometry and speeds to ensure the DCPA increases well beyond the 5 NM minimum.

**Command:**

"FLIGHT1, turn right heading 170 degrees for separation."

**Rationale:**

1.  **Identify Conflict:** FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are on a converging, near head-on course at the same altitude (16200 ft), with a predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) of 141 meters, which is significantly less than the required 5 NM minimum horizontal separation.
2.  **Action Chosen:** A heading change for FLIGHT1 is required as per the instructions.
3.  **Direction and Magnitude:** A turn to the right is chosen, aligning with common procedures for head-on situations. A 30-degree heading change (from 140° to 170°) is a standard vectoring instruction that creates a significant divergence angle from FLIGHT2's track (320°).
4.  **Expected Outcome:** This turn will immediately start increasing the predicted horizontal separation between the aircraft. The 30-degree change is substantial enough to ensure the actual closest point of approach remains well above the 5 NM minimum required separation, thus resolving the conflict without requiring altitude changes or instructions to FLIGHT2.

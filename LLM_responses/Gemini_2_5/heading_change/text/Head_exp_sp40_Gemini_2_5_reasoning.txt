Okay, analyzing the situation:

1.  **Conflict:** FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are at the same altitude (16200 ft), meaning vertical separation is 0 ft. This meets the first condition for Loss of Separation (LOS).
2.  **Prediction:** They are predicted to come within 35.57 meters horizontally (DCPA) in 366.5 seconds. This is far less than the 5 NM minimum horizontal separation required when vertical separation is less than 1000 ft. A LOS is predicted in 299.5 seconds (when horizontal separation drops below 5 NM).
3.  **Geometry:** FLIGHT1 is heading 140°. FLIGHT2 is heading 320° (almost perfectly reciprocal). The QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.96°, meaning FLIGHT2 is almost directly ahead of FLIGHT1. They are essentially on a head-on collision course.
4.  **Dynamics:** FLIGHT1 is very slow (51 kts TAS), while FLIGHT2 is much faster (217 kts TAS). The closure rate is primarily driven by FLIGHT2.
5.  **Constraint:** Only change FLIGHT1's heading.
6.  **Objective:** Turn FLIGHT1 to ensure horizontal separation remains >= 5 NM. The turn should be minimal ("optimal") while guaranteeing safety.

**Reasoning for Action:**

Since the aircraft are on near-reciprocal tracks and at the same altitude, a turn is required for FLIGHT1 to create lateral separation. A turn to the right or left would work geometrically. Standard ATC practice often involves turns of at least 30 degrees for effective separation. Given the near head-on geometry and the very small predicted CPA (35.57 m), a decisive turn is needed. A right turn is a common standard maneuver. Turning FLIGHT1 right by 30-40 degrees will change its trajectory sufficiently to increase the CPA well above the 5 NM minimum. A 30-degree turn is often a standard initial vector.

*   Current Heading FLIGHT1: 140°
*   Proposed Turn: Right 30°
*   New Heading FLIGHT1: 170°

This turn moves FLIGHT1's track away from FLIGHT2's track, resolving the predicted conflict by ensuring the minimum horizontal separation is maintained.

**ATC Command:**

"**FLIGHT1, turn right heading 170, vectoring for traffic.**"

**Rationale for Command:**

*   **Detection:** A conflict was detected between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2, currently at the same altitude (16200 ft) with 0 ft vertical separation.
*   **Prediction:** Their current tracks are predicted to result in a loss of separation (horizontal distance < 5 NM) in approximately 5 minutes (299.5 seconds), with a closest point of approach of only 35.57 meters.
*   **Action:** The command instructs FLIGHT1 to turn right by 30 degrees, from its current heading of 140° to 170°.
*   **Justification:** This heading change creates immediate lateral deviation from the conflicting track of FLIGHT2. Given the near head-on geometry (headings 140° vs 320°) and zero vertical separation, this turn is necessary to ensure the horizontal separation remains above the required minimum of 5 nautical miles. A 30-degree turn is a standard vectoring instruction sufficient to resolve the conflict effectively while being a reasonably minimal deviation ("optimal") under the circumstances. The instruction adheres to the constraint of only modifying FLIGHT1's heading.

Okay, here is the ATC command and rationale based on the provided data:

**ATC Command:**

"FLIGHT1, turn right heading one seven zero."

**Rationale:**

1.  **Conflict Identification:** A loss of separation is predicted between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. Both aircraft are level at 16200 feet (0 ft vertical separation), which is below the 1000 ft minimum vertical separation requirement.
2.  **Converging Tracks:** FLIGHT1 (heading 140°) and FLIGHT2 (heading 320°) are on nearly reciprocal tracks, indicating a head-on or near head-on situation. This is confirmed by the QDR of 140° from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2, which is almost identical to FLIGHT1's heading.
3.  **Imminent Threat:** The predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) is extremely small (44.37 meters), well below the 5 NM minimum horizontal separation required when vertical separation is less than 1000 ft. The TLOS is approximately 5 minutes, requiring immediate action.
4.  **Action Constraint:** The instruction requires resolving the conflict *only* by changing the heading of FLIGHT1.
5.  **Chosen Solution (Turn Right Heading 170°):**
    *   **Direction (Right Turn):** A turn to the right is standard procedure in head-on or near head-on encounters to ensure predictable separation maneuvers.
    *   **Magnitude (30-degree turn to 170°):** A 30-degree heading change is a decisive maneuver that will quickly increase the horizontal distance between the aircraft and significantly increase the predicted CPA. It provides a clear and immediate divergence from the conflicting track of FLIGHT2.
    *   **Optimality:** This 30-degree turn is considered optimal because it's substantial enough to clearly resolve the conflict without requiring an unnecessarily large deviation from FLIGHT1's likely intended route. It directly addresses the head-on geometry and ensures separation will be maintained well above the 5 NM minimum.

This command provides immediate action to increase horizontal separation, resolving the conflict by ensuring the minimum separation criteria (less than 1000 ft vertically *and* less than 5 NM horizontally) are not met simultaneously.

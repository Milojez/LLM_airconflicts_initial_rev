Okay, here is the analysis and command based on the provided data:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict Identification:** FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are at the same altitude (16200 ft), meaning vertical separation is 0 ft, which is less than the 1000 ft minimum required if horizontal separation is also lost.
2.  **Converging Tracks:** FLIGHT1 (heading 140°) and FLIGHT2 (heading 320°) are on nearly reciprocal tracks (140° + 180° = 320°). This indicates a head-on or near head-on encounter geometry.
3.  **Predicted Loss of Separation:** The system predicts a loss of separation (horizontal distance < 5 NM while vertical distance < 1000 ft) is imminent (TLOS ~5 minutes). The predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) is extremely small (130.76 meters), well below the 5 NM (approx 9260 meters) minimum horizontal standard.
4.  **Constraint:** The solution must *only* involve changing the heading of FLIGHT1.
5.  **Required Action:** FLIGHT1 needs a heading change sufficient to increase the predicted horizontal separation at the closest point of approach (CPA) to be greater than 5 NM.
6.  **Optimal Solution:** An optimal solution involves the minimum necessary heading change that ensures safety standards are met, while also considering standard procedures. In head-on or near head-on situations, a turn to the right is standard practice for collision avoidance.

**Determining the Turn:**

*   The aircraft are nearly head-on.
*   A turn to the right for FLIGHT1 will increase separation effectively.
*   A significant turn is needed given the very small predicted DCPA (130m) and the relatively high closing speed (353 kts + 217 kts = 570 kts).
*   A 30-degree turn to the right is a standard initial vectoring value that should provide ample separation in this scenario without being excessively large.

**Command:**

**"FLIGHT1, traffic alert, immediately turn right heading one seven zero."**

**Rationale:**

1.  **Traffic Identification:** The command clearly identifies the aircraft (FLIGHT1) and alerts the pilot to the reason for the maneuver ("traffic alert").
2.  **Immediacy:** The term "immediately" is used because a loss of separation is predicted within approximately 5 minutes, and prompt action is required due to the converging tracks and high closing speed.
3.  **Action - Right Turn:** A turn to the right (from 140° to 170°) is instructed. This aligns with standard collision avoidance procedures in head-on scenarios and effectively moves FLIGHT1's track away from FLIGHT2's track.
4.  **Action - Magnitude (30 degrees):** A 30-degree heading change provides a significant deviation from the conflicting track, ensuring the predicted closest point of approach (CPA) will increase well beyond the 5 NM minimum horizontal separation requirement.
5.  **Constraint Compliance:** This command only modifies the heading of FLIGHT1, adhering to the specified constraint. Altitude remains unchanged.
6.  **Safety:** This maneuver directly addresses the predicted loss of separation by ensuring the minimum horizontal separation standard (5 NM) will not be breached while the aircraft are at the same altitude (0 ft vertical separation).

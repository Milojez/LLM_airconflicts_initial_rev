Okay, here is the analysis and command to resolve the conflict:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict Confirmation:** FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are at the same altitude (16200 ft), meaning vertical separation is 0 ft, which is less than the 1000 ft minimum.
2.  **Convergence:** They are on nearly reciprocal headings (140° vs 320°), indicating a head-on or near head-on convergence.
3.  **Prediction:** The system predicts a loss of separation (horizontal distance < 5 NM) in approximately 5 minutes (TLOS 299.6s), with a very close predicted minimum distance (DCPA 93 meters) occurring shortly after. This confirms an imminent conflict requiring intervention.
4.  **Constraint:** The only available action is to change the heading of FLIGHT1.
5.  **Objective:** Turn FLIGHT1 sufficiently to ensure the horizontal distance never drops below 5 NM. An "optimal" turn is typically the minimum required turn to ensure safety while minimizing deviation from the original flight path.

**Optimal Solution - Heading Change for FLIGHT1:**

*   The aircraft are converging nearly head-on. A turn away from the reciprocal track of FLIGHT2 (320°) is required.
*   FLIGHT1's current heading is 140°. FLIGHT2 is approaching from approximately the 140° direction relative to FLIGHT1 (QDR 139.93°).
*   Turning FLIGHT1 *right* will increase the angular separation between their tracks effectively. A standard vectoring turn is often 30-40 degrees.
*   A 30-degree right turn seems appropriate as a minimal, yet effective, maneuver. This will change FLIGHT1's heading from 140° to 170°. This creates immediate divergence from FLIGHT2's track.

**Command:**

"**FLIGHT1, turn right heading one seven zero, vector for traffic.**"

**Rationale:**

FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are currently at the same altitude (16200 ft) and converging on near-reciprocal tracks. A loss of separation is predicted, with the closest point of approach significantly less than the 5 NM minimum horizontal separation standard required at this altitude difference (0 ft). To resolve this conflict, FLIGHT1 is instructed to turn right by 30 degrees to a heading of 170°. This maneuver creates immediate horizontal divergence from FLIGHT2's track, ensuring that the minimum separation standard of 5 NM horizontally will be maintained. This is considered an optimal command as it's a standard vectoring turn magnitude that effectively resolves the conflict with minimal deviation for FLIGHT1.

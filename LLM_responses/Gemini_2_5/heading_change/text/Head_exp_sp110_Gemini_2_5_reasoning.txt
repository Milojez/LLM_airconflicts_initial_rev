Okay, here is the analysis and command to resolve the conflict:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict Severity:** The aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 ft), meaning the vertical separation criterion for LOS (< 1000 ft) is already met. The conflict hinges entirely on maintaining horizontal separation (> 5 NM).
2.  **Geometry:** FLIGHT1 is heading 140° and FLIGHT2 is heading 320°. These headings are nearly reciprocal (140° + 180° = 320°), indicating an almost direct head-on encounter. The QDR of 139.95° (FLIGHT2 relative to FLIGHT1) confirms FLIGHT2 is almost directly ahead of FLIGHT1 along its current track.
3.  **Prediction:** The predicted DCPA is extremely small (57.56 meters), confirming the head-on nature and the high risk of LOS if no action is taken. The TLOS is approximately 5 minutes away.
4.  **Resolution Constraint:** Only FLIGHT1's heading can be changed.
5.  **Optimal Solution:** In a head-on or near head-on situation at the same altitude, the standard and most intuitive resolution is for aircraft to turn away from each other. Since we can only turn FLIGHT1, a turn to the right is the conventional manoeuvre in many airspaces for head-on conflicts. A significant turn is required to ensure the 5 NM minimum is maintained, given the very small predicted DCPA. A turn of 30-45 degrees should be sufficient. A 40-degree turn provides a good margin.

**Command:**

"**FLIGHT1, turn right heading one eight zero.**"

**Rationale:**

1.  **Immediate Conflict:** FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 are currently at the same altitude (16200 ft) with 0 ft vertical separation.
2.  **Converging Tracks:** Their current headings (140° and 320°) are nearly reciprocal, placing them on a collision course. This is confirmed by the predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) of only 57.56 meters.
3.  **Preventing Loss of Separation:** To prevent the horizontal separation decreasing below the 5 NM minimum, an immediate heading change for FLIGHT1 is required.
4.  **Chosen Action:** A turn to the right is a standard procedure for resolving head-on conflicts. Turning FLIGHT1 right by 40 degrees to a heading of 180° (South) creates immediate horizontal divergence from FLIGHT2's track (approaching from 320° - Northwest).
5.  **Optimality:** This 40-degree turn is a decisive manoeuvre that will rapidly increase the predicted horizontal separation at the closest point of approach, ensuring the 5 NM standard is maintained with a safe margin, thereby resolving the conflict effectively using the permitted action.

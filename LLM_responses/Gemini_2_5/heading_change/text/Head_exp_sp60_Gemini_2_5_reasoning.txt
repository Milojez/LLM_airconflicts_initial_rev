Okay, here is the analysis and command to resolve the conflict:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict Severity:** Critical. Both aircraft are at the exact same altitude (16200 ft), meaning vertical separation is 0 ft. Any horizontal separation less than 5 NM constitutes a Loss of Separation (LOS).
2.  **Geometry:** FLIGHT1 is heading 140 degrees. FLIGHT2 is heading 320 degrees. These are exactly reciprocal headings (140 + 180 = 320). The QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 is 139.96 degrees, almost identical to FLIGHT1's heading. This confirms they are flying directly towards each other on a collision course.
3.  **Prediction:** The predicted closest point of approach (DCPA) is 41.33 meters, which is practically zero separation, confirming the collision course. The TLOS is ~5 minutes, and the TCPA is ~6 minutes. Action is required promptly.
4.  **Constraint:** Only FLIGHT1's heading can be changed.
5.  **Objective:** Change FLIGHT1's heading to ensure the horizontal distance at the CPA remains greater than 5 NM.

**Optimal Heading Change Strategy:**

*   Since the aircraft are head-on, the most effective way to increase separation quickly is a turn that creates significant divergence.
*   Standard procedure and good airmanship in a head-on or near head-on situation often favor a turn to the **right**.
*   A small turn might not be sufficient given the direct collision course and zero vertical separation. A decisive turn is needed.
*   A turn of 30-45 degrees should provide sufficient divergence to guarantee separation well above the 5 NM minimum at the CPA. A 40-degree turn is a good balance between effectiveness and minimizing excessive deviation.

**Command:**

**"FLIGHT1, turn right heading one eight zero."**

**Rationale:**

1.  **Addresses Conflict:** This command directly addresses the head-on collision course with FLIGHT2.
2.  **Creates Divergence:** Turning FLIGHT1 right by 40 degrees (from 140 to 180) immediately changes the geometry from head-on to diverging tracks.
3.  **Ensures Separation:** This significant heading change will rapidly increase the predicted horizontal separation at the closest point of approach (CPA), ensuring it remains safely above the 5 NM minimum required since vertical separation is zero.
4.  **Standard Practice:** A right turn is generally preferred in head-on scenarios.
5.  **Timeliness:** The command provides sufficient time to resolve the conflict before the predicted TLOS (299.5 seconds).

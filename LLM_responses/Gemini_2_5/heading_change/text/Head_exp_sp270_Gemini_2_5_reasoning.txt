Okay, here is the analysis and command based on the provided data:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict:** A loss of separation is predicted between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2.
2.  **Vertical Separation:** Currently 0 feet (both at 16200 ft). This means the vertical separation criterion (< 1000 ft) for a loss of separation is already met.
3.  **Horizontal Separation:** Currently 51.49 NM, which is well above the 5 NM minimum.
4.  **Tracks:** FLIGHT1 is heading 140°, FLIGHT2 is heading 320°. These are almost perfectly reciprocal headings (140° + 180° = 320°), indicating they are flying directly towards each other.
5.  **Prediction:** The system predicts the closest point of approach (DCPA) will be extremely small (125.75 meters) in about 5.5 minutes (331.9 seconds), and a loss of separation (horizontal distance < 5 NM while vertical < 1000 ft) is predicted even sooner, in about 5 minutes (299.6 seconds).
6.  **Constraint:** The only available action is to change the heading of FLIGHT1. Vertical changes are not permitted by the instruction.
7.  **Required Action:** To prevent the loss of separation, horizontal separation must be increased and maintained above 5 NM. Since the aircraft are converging head-on, a turn is necessary.
8.  **Optimal Turn:** An "optimal" turn should resolve the conflict efficiently with minimum deviation. A standard vectoring turn is typically 30-45 degrees. Given the head-on trajectory (QDR 139.92° is almost identical to FLIGHT1's heading of 140°), turning right is a standard procedure and effective. A 40-degree turn to the right should provide sufficient separation quickly.

**Command:**

"FLIGHT1, turn right heading one eight zero."

**Rationale:**

1.  **Conflict Identification:** A loss of separation was predicted between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 due to converging tracks at the same altitude (16200 ft).
2.  **Immediate Vertical Risk:** Vertical separation is currently zero, satisfying one condition for loss of separation.
3.  **Converging Tracks:** FLIGHT1 (heading 140°) and FLIGHT2 (heading 320°) are on near-reciprocal courses, leading to a predicted very close point of approach (DCPA 125.75 m).
4.  **Action Required:** To prevent horizontal separation dropping below the 5 NM minimum while vertical separation remains zero, a heading change is required for FLIGHT1 (as per constraints).
5.  **Chosen Command:** A right turn to heading 180° for FLIGHT1 was selected.
6.  **Optimality & Effectiveness:** This represents a 40-degree turn, which is a standard vectoring magnitude sufficient to quickly increase horizontal separation and diverge the flight paths, preventing the predicted loss of separation. Turning right is often standard practice in head-on scenarios and effectively moves FLIGHT1 away from FLIGHT2's track. This resolves the conflict using the only permitted method (changing FLIGHT1's heading) in an efficient manner.

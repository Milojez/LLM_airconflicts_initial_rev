Okay, analyzing the situation:

1.  **Conflict Confirmation:** Vertical separation is 0 ft (less than 1000 ft). Horizontal separation is 26.27 NM but decreasing. A loss of separation (LOS) is predicted because both conditions (Vertical < 1000 ft and Horizontal < 5 NM) are expected to be met simultaneously (TLOS 299.5s). The predicted closest point (DCPA) is extremely small (32.84 meters), confirming a high-risk encounter.
2.  **Geometry:** FLIGHT1 (heading 140°) and FLIGHT2 (heading 320°) are on almost perfectly reciprocal tracks (140° + 180° = 320°). The QDR from FLIGHT1 to FLIGHT2 (139.96°) is almost identical to FLIGHT1's heading, confirming they are essentially head-on.
3.  **Dynamics:** FLIGHT2 is significantly faster (217 kts TAS) than FLIGHT1 (51 kts TAS). The closing speed is high (approx. 51 + 217 = 268 knots).
4.  **Constraint:** Only FLIGHT1's heading can be changed.
5.  **Objective:** Change FLIGHT1's heading to ensure horizontal separation remains >= 5 NM at all times. The solution should be "optimal," implying effectiveness (guaranteed separation) and reasonable efficiency (not an unnecessarily large deviation, if possible, but safety first).

**Reasoning for Action:**

*   Since the aircraft are head-on and vertical separation is already zero, a horizontal turn is mandatory for FLIGHT1.
*   A small turn might not be sufficient given the very small DCPA (32 meters) and the high closing speed. We need a decisive maneuver.
*   Turning right is often standard procedure in head-on situations.
*   A turn of at least 30-45 degrees is advisable to create significant lateral separation quickly. A 45-degree turn provides a good balance between ensuring separation and minimizing deviation compared to a 90-degree turn.
*   A 45-degree right turn for FLIGHT1 changes its heading from 140° to 185° (140 + 45 = 185). This creates a significant angle difference relative to FLIGHT2's track (320°), ensuring they diverge horizontally well before reaching the 5 NM minimum.

**ATC Command:**

"FLIGHT1, turn right heading one eight five, for traffic."

**Rationale for Command:**

A potential loss of separation exists between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2. Both aircraft are at the same altitude (16200 ft), and their current tracks are nearly reciprocal (140° vs 320°), leading to a predicted minimum horizontal distance (DCPA) of only 32.84 meters. To ensure the minimum required separation of 5 NM horizontally is maintained (as vertical separation is already less than 1000 ft), a heading change for FLIGHT1 is required. A 45-degree right turn to heading 185° is issued. This maneuver creates immediate and significant horizontal divergence from FLIGHT2's track, effectively resolving the conflict in a timely manner while adhering to the constraint of only modifying FLIGHT1's heading. A right turn is chosen for predictability in a head-on scenario, and 45 degrees provides sufficient clearance without excessive deviation.

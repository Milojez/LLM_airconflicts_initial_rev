Okay, analyzing the situation:

1.  **Conflict Type:** Overtaking situation at the same altitude (FL252). FLIGHT2 is significantly faster (412 kts) than FLIGHT1 (245 kts) and is approaching from behind on the same heading (216 degrees).
2.  **Urgency:** TLOS is ~5 minutes (299.1s), and the predicted closest approach (DCPA) is extremely small (15.73 meters), indicating a high risk of collision if no action is taken.
3.  **Separation:** Currently 18.87 NM horizontally, but 0 ft vertically. The primary issue is the lack of vertical separation combined with the decreasing horizontal separation due to the speed difference.
4.  **Available Solutions:** Vertical separation (altitude change), horizontal separation (heading change), or longitudinal separation (speed change).

**Analysis of Solutions:**

*   **Speed Change:** Asking FLIGHT2 to slow down significantly (by ~167 knots) would be inefficient and might still require vectoring later. Asking FLIGHT1 to speed up might not be feasible for a B747 at that altitude/weight. Not the ideal primary solution.
*   **Heading Change:** Turning either aircraft would create lateral separation. However, since they are on the same track, a vertical separation is often cleaner and more standard for overtaking traffic, avoiding route deviations.
*   **Altitude Change:** This is the most direct and standard method to resolve a conflict with zero vertical separation. Assigning one aircraft a different flight level provides the required 1000 ft minimum vertical separation immediately (below FL290).

**Decision:**

The most appropriate and immediate action is to apply vertical separation. It's standard practice to move the overtaking aircraft. Therefore, FLIGHT2 should be assigned a different altitude. Descending FLIGHT2 is a common option.

**Command:**

**"FLIGHT2, descend and maintain Flight Level Two Four Zero."**

**Alternative Command (Climbing):**

If FL260 is clear and suitable based on direction of flight rules (e.g., Eastbound odd, Westbound even - though 216 is Southwest), climbing could also be an option:

**"FLIGHT2, climb and maintain Flight Level Two Six Zero."**

**Justification:**

Issuing an altitude change to FLIGHT2 immediately establishes the required 1000 ft vertical separation, resolving the conflict efficiently and safely according to standard ATC procedures for overtaking traffic. Descending to FL240 is chosen here as a standard separation maneuver.

Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the appropriate commands.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Conflict Type:** Converging conflict at the same altitude (FL208 / 20800 ft). Vertical separation is zero.
2.  **Urgency:** TLOS is ~5 minutes (299.5s), and the predicted closest approach (DCPA) is extremely small (193m / ~0.1 NM). Action is required promptly.
3.  **Aircraft Dynamics:**
    *   FLIGHT1: Slower (268 kts), heading Northeast (071).
    *   FLIGHT2: Faster (392 kts), heading Southeast (161). FLIGHT2 is closing the distance faster.
4.  **Relative Position:** FLIGHT2 is 44.5 NM North-Northeast (15.56 deg) of FLIGHT1.
5.  **Resolution Options:** Vertical separation (altitude change) or horizontal separation (heading change) are the primary methods. Speed adjustments are generally less immediate for resolving conflicts this close in time with such a small predicted DCPA.

**Decision:**

Assigning a different altitude is the most effective and immediate way to resolve a conflict when aircraft are level. This eliminates the risk of horizontal separation loss entirely. A heading change is a viable alternative but requires more monitoring to ensure separation increases.

**Preferred Solution: Vertical Separation**

Standard IFR separation requires at least 1000 ft vertically below FL290. Since both are at 20800 ft, one aircraft needs to be moved to at least 21800 ft or 19800 ft. Using standard Flight Levels (ending in 000), the closest options are FL190, FL200, FL220, FL230 etc. To ensure the 1000ft minimum *from the other aircraft's altitude*, we need to assign an altitude that is at least 1000ft away from 20800ft.

*   Option A: Move FLIGHT1 down to FL190 (19000 ft).
*   Option B: Move FLIGHT2 up to FL220 (22000 ft).

Given FLIGHT2 is faster, climbing might be slightly more efficient if its destination is further north, but either option is safe. Let's choose to climb FLIGHT2 for this example.

**Command (Primary - Vertical):**

"**FLIGHT2, climb and maintain Flight Level Two Two Zero.**"

*Optional addition with traffic information:*
"**FLIGHT2, traffic alert, FLIGHT1, one o'clock, four four miles, converging course, level Flight Level Two Zero Eight. Climb and maintain Flight Level Two Two Zero.**"

*(Rationale for traffic info: Bearing from FLT2 to FLT1 is 195.56 deg (15.56+180). Relative to FLT2's heading of 161 deg, this is 195.56 - 161 = ~35 degrees right, which is approximately the 1 o'clock position).*

**Alternative Solution: Horizontal Separation (Heading Change)**

If vertical separation is not feasible (e.g., due to other traffic or airspace constraints), a heading change is necessary. Turning one aircraft away from the other is required. Turning the faster aircraft (FLIGHT2) right would create divergence quickly.

**Command (Alternative - Horizontal):**

"**FLIGHT2, turn right heading One Niner Zero, vector for traffic.**"

*(Rationale: A turn of ~30 degrees right (from 161 to 190) will immediately increase the horizontal separation rate).*

**Conclusion:**

The primary and most recommended command is to apply vertical separation due to its immediacy and certainty.

**Recommended Command:**

"**FLIGHT2, climb and maintain Flight Level Two Two Zero.**" (Or alternatively, "FLIGHT1, descend and maintain Flight Level One Niner Zero.")

Okay, analyzing the situation:

1.  **Aircraft:** FLIGHT1 (FL160, level) and FLIGHT2 (FL180 descending).
2.  **Conflict:** FLIGHT2 is descending towards FLIGHT1's altitude. Although currently separated by ~2000 ft vertically, this separation is decreasing rapidly (-657 ft/min). The horizontal separation (9.65 NM) is also decreasing due to converging tracks (319° vs 304°) and FLIGHT2 being faster.
3.  **Urgency:** TLOS is ~3.3 minutes, and the predicted DCPA is extremely close (5.26 meters), indicating a high risk of separation infringement if no action is taken.
4.  **Key Problem:** FLIGHT2's descent path conflicts vertically and horizontally with FLIGHT1's level flight path.

**Necessary Commands:**

The most immediate threat is the loss of vertical separation due to FLIGHT2's descent. The converging tracks exacerbate the situation. A combination of vertical and horizontal maneuvers is often the safest approach.

**Primary Command (Vertical Resolution):**

*   **Target:** FLIGHT2 (The descending aircraft creating the vertical conflict).
*   **Action:** Stop the descent well above FLIGHT1.
*   **Command:** **"FLIGHT2, stop descent immediately, maintain Flight Level One Eight Zero."**
    *   *Reasoning:* This immediately halts the reduction in vertical separation, keeping FLIGHT2 at FL180 (or slightly above where it currently is), ensuring at least the standard 1000 ft (actually closer to 2000 ft initially) vertical separation from FLIGHT1 at FL160.

**Secondary Command (Horizontal Resolution - Recommended for robustness):**

While stopping the descent might eventually resolve the conflict as FLIGHT2 passes overhead/ahead, the predicted close CPA and converging tracks warrant a horizontal maneuver to ensure positive separation more quickly and definitively. Turning the lower aircraft (FLIGHT1) is often preferred if possible.

*   **Target:** FLIGHT1 (Lower, slower aircraft).
*   **Action:** Turn away from FLIGHT2's track. FLIGHT2 is at QDR 75.78° (roughly ENE) from FLIGHT1. A right turn for FLIGHT1 will increase separation.
*   **Command:** **"FLIGHT1, turn right heading Three Six Zero."** (Or another heading further right like 010/020 depending on downstream routing).
    *   *Reasoning:* FLIGHT1's current heading is 319°. A turn right to 360° (or more) creates immediate divergence from FLIGHT2's track (304°), increasing horizontal separation rapidly.

**Combined Instruction Set:**

1.  **"FLIGHT2, stop descent immediately, maintain Flight Level One Eight Zero."**
2.  **"FLIGHT1, turn right heading Three Six Zero."**

This combination provides both immediate vertical safety and proactive horizontal separation. Monitor the situation closely after issuing the commands to ensure compliance and effectiveness.

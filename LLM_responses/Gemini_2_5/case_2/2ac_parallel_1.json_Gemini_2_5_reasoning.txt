Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.

**1. Understand the Loss of Separation Criteria:**
*   Vertical distance < 1000 feet
*   Horizontal distance < 5 nautical miles (NM)
*   Both conditions must be met simultaneously.

**2. Analyze Vertical Separation:**
*   FLIGHT1 Altitude: 25200 feet
*   FLIGHT2 Altitude: 25200 feet
*   Vertical Rate (Both): 0 feet/min (level flight)
*   **Calculation:** Vertical distance = |25200 ft - 25200 ft| = 0 feet.
*   **Conclusion:** The vertical distance (0 ft) is less than 1000 ft. The first condition for LoS is met and will remain met as long as both aircraft maintain level flight at this altitude.

**3. Analyze Horizontal Separation:**

*   **a. Current Horizontal Distance:**
    *   Convert coordinates from meters to a common frame if needed (though distance calculation works directly).
    *   FLIGHT1: (x1, y1) = (515161.1758 m, 2536816.8443 m)
    *   FLIGHT2: (x2, y2) = (535663.0858 m, 2565002.2207 m)
    *   Calculate the difference in coordinates:
        *   Δx = x2 - x1 = 535663.0858 - 515161.1758 = 20501.91 meters
        *   Δy = y2 - y1 = 2565002.2207 - 2536816.8443 = 28185.3764 meters
    *   Calculate the horizontal distance using the Pythagorean theorem:
        *   Distance (meters) = sqrt(Δx² + Δy²)
        *   Distance (meters) = sqrt((20501.91)² + (28185.3764)²)
        *   Distance (meters) = sqrt(420328313.6 + 794416117.8)
        *   Distance (meters) = sqrt(1214744431.4) ≈ 34853.18 meters
    *   Convert meters to nautical miles (1 NM ≈ 1852 meters):
        *   Distance (NM) = 34853.18 / 1852 ≈ 18.82 NM
    *   **Conclusion (Current):** The current horizontal distance (18.82 NM) is greater than 5 NM. Currently, there is no LoS.

*   **b. Future Horizontal Separation (Trajectory Analysis):**
    *   Both aircraft are flying the same heading (216 degrees).
    *   FLIGHT1 Ground Speed: 245 knots
    *   FLIGHT2 Ground Speed: 412 knots
    *   FLIGHT2 is faster than FLIGHT1.
    *   To determine if they are converging or diverging along the track, we need to know which one is "ahead" on the 216-degree track. FLIGHT2 has larger X and Y coordinates, placing it North-East of FLIGHT1. Since the heading (216°) is South-West, FLIGHT2 is *behind* FLIGHT1 along the track.
    *   Since FLIGHT2 is behind FLIGHT1 on the same track and is faster, FLIGHT2 is overtaking FLIGHT1.
    *   The closing speed (relative speed) along the track is the difference between their speeds:
        *   Closing Speed = Speed_FLIGHT2 - Speed_FLIGHT1 = 412 knots - 245 knots = 167 knots.
    *   The horizontal distance is currently 18.82 NM and is decreasing at a rate of 167 knots (NM/hour).
    *   Calculate the time until the horizontal distance reduces to the minimum required separation (5 NM):
        *   Distance to close = Current Distance - Minimum Distance = 18.82 NM - 5 NM = 13.82 NM
        *   Time = Distance to close / Closing Speed
        *   Time (hours) = 13.82 NM / 167 knots ≈ 0.08276 hours
        *   Time (minutes) = 0.08276 hours * 60 min/hour ≈ 4.97 minutes.

**4. Predict Loss of Separation:**
*   Vertical separation is currently 0 ft (< 1000 ft) and will remain so.
*   Horizontal separation is currently 18.82 NM (> 5 NM) but will decrease below 5 NM in approximately 5 minutes.
*   **Conclusion:** Yes, a loss of separation is predicted to occur in approximately **5 minutes** because both the vertical (< 1000 ft) and horizontal (< 5 NM) criteria will be met simultaneously.

**5. Determine Necessary Command(s):**

A loss of separation is imminent due to FLIGHT2 overtaking FLIGHT1 at the same altitude on the same track. Action must be taken immediately. Priority is usually given to resolving the vertical conflict or vectoring one aircraft off the track.

*   **Option 1: Vertical Separation (Preferred in many cases for same-track conflicts):** Assign a different altitude to one of the aircraft. Since FLIGHT2 is overtaking, assigning it a different altitude is logical.
    *   **Command:** "FLIGHT2, climb and maintain Flight Level 260." (Or descend to FL 240, depending on surrounding traffic and direction of flight rules).
*   **Option 2: Horizontal Separation (Vectoring):** Turn one aircraft off the track to create horizontal spacing. Turning the overtaking aircraft (FLIGHT2) is often efficient.
    *   **Command:** "FLIGHT2, turn left heading 180, vector for separation." (A turn of 30 degrees or more is standard). Or "FLIGHT1, turn right heading 240, vector for separation."
*   **Option 3: Speed Control:** Instruct the overtaking aircraft to slow down. Given the high closing speed (167 knots), a significant speed reduction would be needed immediately.
    *   **Command:** "FLIGHT2, reduce speed to 250 knots." (This would immediately stop the closure, but might be below FLIGHT2's efficient cruising speed).

**Recommended Command:**

Given the situation (same track, same altitude, overtaking), providing vertical separation is a standard and effective solution.

**Primary Recommended Command:**

*   **"FLIGHT2, climb and maintain Flight Level 260."**

**Alternative Command (if vertical separation is not feasible):**

*   **"FLIGHT2, turn left heading 180."**

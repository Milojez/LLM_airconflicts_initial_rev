Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.

**1. Define Loss of Separation (LoS) Criteria:**
*   Vertical distance < 1000 feet AND
*   Horizontal distance < 5 nautical miles (NM)
*   Both conditions must be met simultaneously.

**2. Convert Units for Calculation:**
*   Horizontal distance threshold: 5 NM = 5 * 1852 meters = 9260 meters
*   Speeds to meters per minute (m/min): 1 knot ≈ 1852 m/hour ≈ 30.867 m/min
    *   FLIGHT1 Speed (v1): 242 knots * 30.867 m/min/knot ≈ 7469.8 m/min
    *   FLIGHT2 Speed (v2): 290 knots * 30.867 m/min/knot ≈ 8951.4 m/min
*   Headings to radians (for trigonometric functions, measured clockwise from North):
    *   FLIGHT1 Heading (θ1): 319° = 319 * π / 180 ≈ 5.5676 radians
    *   FLIGHT2 Heading (θ2): 304° = 304 * π / 180 ≈ 5.3060 radians

**3. Calculate Initial Separation (Time t=0):**
*   **Vertical Separation:**
    *   ΔAlt = |Altitude(FLIGHT2) - Altitude(FLIGHT1)|
    *   ΔAlt = |18084 ft - 16000 ft| = 2084 ft
    *   *Result: Current vertical separation (2084 ft) is >= 1000 ft.*
*   **Horizontal Separation:**
    *   Δx = x(FLIGHT2) - x(FLIGHT1) = 490200.0304 m - 472740.4566 m = 17459.57 m
    *   Δy = y(FLIGHT2) - y(FLIGHT1) = 8975136.8901 m - 8971043.1425 m = 4093.75 m
    *   Horizontal Distance (H) = sqrt(Δx² + Δy²) = sqrt(17459.57² + 4093.75²)
    *   H = sqrt(304837396 + 16758772) = sqrt(321596168) ≈ 17933.1 m
    *   H (NM) = 17933.1 m / 1852 m/NM ≈ 9.68 NM
    *   *Result: Current horizontal separation (9.68 NM) is >= 5 NM.*
*   **Conclusion (t=0):** The aircraft are currently safely separated.

**4. Predict Future Positions and Separation:**
*   Assume constant velocity (ground speed, heading, vertical rate) for prediction. Let 't' be time in minutes from now.
*   **Velocity Components (vx = speed * sin(θ), vy = speed * cos(θ)):**
    *   FLIGHT1:
        *   vx1 = 7469.8 * sin(5.5676) ≈ 7469.8 * (-0.6561) ≈ -4901.1 m/min
        *   vy1 = 7469.8 * cos(5.5676) ≈ 7469.8 * (0.7547) ≈ 5637.6 m/min
    *   FLIGHT2:
        *   vx2 = 8951.4 * sin(5.3060) ≈ 8951.4 * (-0.8290) ≈ -7420.7 m/min
        *   vy2 = 8951.4 * cos(5.3060) ≈ 8951.4 * (0.5592) ≈ 5005.7 m/min
*   **Position at time 't':**
    *   x1(t) = 472740.46 - 4901.1 * t
    *   y1(t) = 8971043.14 + 5637.6 * t
    *   x2(t) = 490200.03 - 7420.7 * t
    *   y2(t) = 8975136.89 + 5005.7 * t
*   **Altitude at time 't':**
    *   Alt1(t) = 16000 ft
    *   Alt2(t) = 18084 - 657 * t ft

**5. Analyze Separation Over Time:**
*   **Vertical Separation V(t):**
    *   V(t) = |Alt2(t) - Alt1(t)| = |(18084 - 657 * t) - 16000| = |2084 - 657 * t|
    *   When will V(t) < 1000 ft?
        *   -1000 < 2084 - 657 * t < 1000
        *   From 2084 - 657 * t < 1000 => 1084 < 657 * t => t > 1084 / 657 ≈ 1.65 minutes
        *   From -1000 < 2084 - 657 * t => 657 * t < 3084 => t < 3084 / 657 ≈ 4.69 minutes
        *   *Result: Vertical separation is predicted to be less than 1000 ft between t ≈ 1.65 min and t ≈ 4.69 min.*
*   **Horizontal Separation H(t):**
    *   Δx(t) = x2(t) - x1(t) = (490200.03 - 7420.7*t) - (472740.46 - 4901.1*t) = 17459.57 - 2519.6 * t
    *   Δy(t) = y2(t) - y1(t) = (8975136.89 + 5005.7*t) - (8971043.14 + 5637.6*t) = 4093.75 - 631.9 * t
    *   H(t)² = Δx(t)² + Δy(t)² = (17459.57 - 2519.6 * t)² + (4093.75 - 631.9 * t)²
    *   When will H(t) < 5 NM (9260 m)? We need H(t)² < 9260² = 85747600.
    *   Setting H(t)² = 85747600 leads to a quadratic equation:
        *   6747684 * t² - 93175872 * t + 235848568 = 0 (Derived in thought process)
        *   Solving for t: t² - 13.808 * t + 34.952 = 0
        *   Using the quadratic formula, t = [13.808 ± sqrt(13.808² - 4*1*34.952)] / 2
        *   t = [13.808 ± sqrt(190.66 - 139.81)] / 2 = [13.808 ± sqrt(50.85)] / 2 = [13.808 ± 7.131] / 2
        *   t1 ≈ (13.808 - 7.131) / 2 ≈ 3.34 minutes
        *   t2 ≈ (13.808 + 7.131) / 2 ≈ 10.47 minutes
        *   *Result: Horizontal separation is predicted to be less than 5 NM between t ≈ 3.34 min and t ≈ 10.47 min.*

**6. Check for Simultaneous Loss of Separation:**
*   Vertical separation < 1000 ft during time interval: (1.65 min, 4.69 min)
*   Horizontal separation < 5 NM during time interval: (3.34 min, 10.47 min)
*   We need the time interval where *both* conditions are met. This is the intersection of the two intervals.
*   Intersection = (3.34 min, 4.69 min)

**Conclusion on Loss of Separation:**
Yes, based on the current trajectories and rates, a loss of separation **is predicted** to occur. It will start approximately **3.3 minutes** from now (when horizontal separation drops below 5 NM while vertical separation is already below 1000 ft) and end approximately **4.7 minutes** from now (when vertical separation increases back above 1000 ft).

**7. Determine Necessary Command(s):**
A loss of separation is predicted within the next 5 minutes. Action is required immediately. The conflict arises because FLIGHT2 is descending towards FLIGHT1's altitude while they are converging horizontally.

*   **Primary Cause:** FLIGHT2's descent.
*   **Most Direct Solution:** Stop the vertical convergence.

**Recommended Command:**

Issue an immediate instruction to the descending aircraft, FLIGHT2:

*   **"FLIGHT2, LEVEL OFF IMMEDIATELY, MAINTAIN FLIGHT LEVEL ONE EIGHT ZERO."** (Or instruct to maintain its current altitude if FL180 is not yet appropriate based on altimeter setting, e.g., "MAINTAIN ONE EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FEET").

**Justification:**
*   This command directly addresses the vertical conflict by stopping FLIGHT2's descent before it reaches 1000 ft separation from FLIGHT1.
*   It is a standard, clear, and immediate instruction.
*   It provides immediate vertical separation and allows time to assess further actions if needed (like rerouting or resuming descent later).

**Alternative (if leveling off is not desired/possible):**

*   **"FLIGHT2, TURN LEFT HEADING TWO EIGHT ZERO."** (A turn away from FLIGHT1's track to increase horizontal separation quickly).

**Reasoning for Alternative:** A heading change is also effective. A left turn for FLIGHT2 increases the angle between their tracks and rapidly increases horizontal distance, resolving the conflict while potentially allowing FLIGHT2 to continue its descent, although coordination might be needed later. However, stopping the descent is generally the most direct resolution for this specific geometry.

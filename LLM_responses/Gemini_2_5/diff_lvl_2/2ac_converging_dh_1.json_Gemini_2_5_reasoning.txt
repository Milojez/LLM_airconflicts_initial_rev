Okay, let's break down this scenario step-by-step.

**1. Understand the Loss of Separation Criteria:**
*   Vertical distance < 1000 feet AND
*   Horizontal distance < 5 nautical miles (NM)
*   Both conditions must be met simultaneously.

**2. Initial Separation Assessment:**

*   **Vertical Separation:**
    *   FLIGHT2 Altitude: 19093 ft
    *   FLIGHT1 Altitude: 18000 ft
    *   Initial Vertical Distance = 19093 - 18000 = 1093 ft
    *   *Status:* Currently > 1000 ft. Vertical separation exists.

*   **Horizontal Separation:**
    *   FLIGHT1 Coordinates (x1, y1): (472742.13 m, 8971041.11 m)
    *   FLIGHT2 Coordinates (x2, y2): (500862.89 m, 8968825.83 m)
    *   Calculate difference in coordinates:
        *   Δx = x2 - x1 = 500862.89 - 472742.13 = 28120.76 m
        *   Δy = y2 - y1 = 8968825.83 - 8971041.11 = -2215.28 m
    *   Calculate horizontal distance using Pythagoras theorem:
        *   Distance (meters) = sqrt(Δx² + Δy²)
        *   Distance = sqrt(28120.76² + (-2215.28)²)
        *   Distance = sqrt(790777410.3 + 4907472.9)
        *   Distance = sqrt(795684883.2) ≈ 28207.9 m
    *   Convert meters to nautical miles (1 NM ≈ 1852 m):
        *   Distance (NM) = 28207.9 m / 1852 m/NM ≈ 15.23 NM
    *   *Status:* Currently > 5 NM. Horizontal separation exists.

*   **Initial Conclusion:** Currently, there is no loss of separation.

**3. Future Trajectory Prediction:**

*   We need to predict if their paths will bring them into conflict. We'll model their movement as straight lines based on current speed and heading.
*   **Convert Speeds:** Convert knots to meters per minute (m/min) for calculations (1 knot ≈ 1852 m/hour ≈ 30.87 m/min).
    *   FLIGHT1 Speed: 237 knots * 30.87 m/min/knot ≈ 7316.2 m/min
    *   FLIGHT2 Speed: 335 knots * 30.87 m/min/knot ≈ 10341.5 m/min
*   **Calculate Velocity Components (Vx, Vy):** Using Heading (θ) measured clockwise from North (Y-axis). Vx = Speed * sin(θ), Vy = Speed * cos(θ). Convert degrees to radians for calculations (radians = degrees * π / 180).
    *   **FLIGHT1:**
        *   Heading: 319° (≈ 5.567 rad)
        *   Vx1 = 7316.2 * sin(319°) ≈ 7316.2 * (-0.656) ≈ -4799.8 m/min
        *   Vy1 = 7316.2 * cos(319°) ≈ 7316.2 * (0.755) ≈ 5523.7 m/min
        *   Altitude(t) = 18000 ft (since VR = 0)
    *   **FLIGHT2:**
        *   Heading: 304° (≈ 5.306 rad)
        *   Vx2 = 10341.5 * sin(304°) ≈ 10341.5 * (-0.829) ≈ -8573.1 m/min
        *   Vy2 = 10341.5 * cos(304°) ≈ 10341.5 * (0.559) ≈ 5780.9 m/min
        *   Altitude(t) = 19093 - 71 * t (where t is in minutes)
*   **Relative Velocity:**
    *   ΔVx = Vx2 - Vx1 = -8573.1 - (-4799.8) = -3773.3 m/min
    *   ΔVy = Vy2 - Vy1 = 5780.9 - 5523.7 = 257.2 m/min
*   **Position Equations over Time (t in minutes):**
    *   Δx(t) = Initial Δx + ΔVx * t = 28120.76 - 3773.3 * t
    *   Δy(t) = Initial Δy + ΔVy * t = -2215.28 + 257.2 * t
    *   ΔAlt(t) = Initial ΔAlt + (VR2 - VR1) * t = 1093 + (-71 - 0) * t = 1093 - 71 * t

**4. Calculate Time of Closest Horizontal Approach (CPA):**
*   Minimize the horizontal distance squared: D_h²(t) = Δx(t)² + Δy(t)²
*   Find when the derivative d(D_h²)/dt = 0.
    *   d(D_h²)/dt = 2 * Δx(t) * ΔVx + 2 * Δy(t) * ΔVy = 0
    *   (28120.76 - 3773.3 * t) * (-3773.3) + (-2215.28 + 257.2 * t) * (257.2) = 0
    *   -106113960 + 14237813 * t - 569868 + 66151.84 * t = 0
    *   -106683828 + 14303965 * t = 0
    *   t = 106683828 / 14303965 ≈ 7.46 minutes

**5. Calculate Separation at CPA (t ≈ 7.46 min):**

*   **Horizontal Separation at t = 7.46 min:**
    *   Δx(7.46) = 28120.76 - 3773.3 * 7.46 ≈ 28120.76 - 28148.8 ≈ -28.0 m
    *   Δy(7.46) = -2215.28 + 257.2 * 7.46 ≈ -2215.28 + 1918.6 ≈ -296.7 m
    *   D_h(7.46) = sqrt((-28.0)² + (-296.7)²) = sqrt(784 + 88031) = sqrt(88815) ≈ 298.0 m
    *   D_h(7.46) in NM = 298.0 m / 1852 m/NM ≈ 0.16 NM
    *   *Status at CPA:* 0.16 NM < 5 NM. Horizontal separation minimum *will be breached*.

*   **Vertical Separation at t = 7.46 min:**
    *   ΔAlt(7.46) = 1093 - 71 * 7.46 ≈ 1093 - 529.7 ≈ 563.3 ft
    *   *Status at CPA:* 563.3 ft < 1000 ft. Vertical separation minimum *will be breached*.

**6. Loss of Separation Determination:**

*   At the time of closest horizontal approach (approximately 7.5 minutes from now), the predicted horizontal separation is ~0.16 NM (less than 5 NM) and the predicted vertical separation is ~563 ft (less than 1000 ft).
*   Since both conditions are predicted to be met simultaneously, **Yes, a loss of separation is predicted.**
*   The LoS is predicted to occur around **7.5 minutes** from the current time. (We could calculate the exact time window where *both* conditions are true, but the CPA analysis is sufficient to determine a conflict exists).

**7. Necessary Command(s):**

*   **Analysis:** FLIGHT2 is faster, behind and slightly to the East of FLIGHT1, on a converging heading, and descending towards FLIGHT1's altitude. The primary immediate threat is the decreasing vertical separation combined with the rapidly decreasing horizontal separation.
*   **Priority:** Prevent the vertical separation from decreasing below 1000 ft.
*   **Action:** The simplest and most effective immediate action is to stop FLIGHT2's descent.
*   **Command:**
    *   **"FLIGHT2, maintain one niner thousand."**

*   **Justification:**
    *   This command immediately halts the decrease in vertical separation, ensuring it remains at the current 1093 ft (which is > 1000 ft).
    *   While the horizontal separation will still decrease significantly (reaching ~0.16 NM), maintaining the vertical separation prevents the *simultaneous* breach required for a LoS.
    *   This is a standard and efficient resolution for this type of conflict. Further vectoring (heading changes) could be considered for increased horizontal spacing if desired after the vertical conflict is resolved, but stopping the descent is the critical first step.

**Summary:**

1.  **Loss of Separation Prediction:** Yes, a loss of separation is predicted between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2.
2.  **Time:** The closest point of approach, where both vertical and horizontal minima are expected to be breached, is approximately **7.5 minutes** from now.
3.  **Required Command:** Issue an altitude restriction to FLIGHT2.
    *   **"FLIGHT2, maintain one niner thousand."**

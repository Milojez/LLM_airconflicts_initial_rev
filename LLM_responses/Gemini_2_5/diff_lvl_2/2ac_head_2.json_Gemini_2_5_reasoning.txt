Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine if a loss of separation will occur and what commands are necessary.

**1. Understand Loss of Separation Criteria:**
*   Vertical distance < 1000 feet **AND**
*   Horizontal distance < 5 nautical miles (NM)
*   Both conditions must be met simultaneously.

**2. Current Aircraft Data:**
*   **FLIGHT1 (B737):**
    *   Position (x, y): (500490.04 m, 2775551.62 m)
    *   Altitude: 16800 ft
    *   Ground Speed (GS): 292 knots
    *   Heading (HDG): 140°
    *   Vertical Rate (VR): 0 ft/min
*   **FLIGHT2 (B777):**
    *   Position (x, y): (558201.60 m, 2707616.21 m)
    *   Altitude: 18298 ft
    *   Ground Speed (GS): 227 knots
    *   Heading (HDG): 320°
    *   Vertical Rate (VR): -100 ft/min

**3. Calculate Current Separation:**
*   **Vertical Separation:**
    *   Altitude Difference = |18298 ft - 16800 ft| = 1498 ft
    *   *Condition Check:* 1498 ft >= 1000 ft. Currently, vertical separation is sufficient.
*   **Horizontal Separation:**
    *   Δx = 558201.60 m - 500490.04 m = 57711.56 m
    *   Δy = 2707616.21 m - 2775551.62 m = -67935.41 m
    *   Horizontal Distance (meters) = sqrt(Δx² + Δy²)
    *   Distance = sqrt((57711.56)² + (-67935.41)²)
    *   Distance = sqrt(3330622343 + 4615220348) = sqrt(7945842691) ≈ 89139.46 meters
    *   Convert meters to nautical miles (1 NM ≈ 1852 meters):
    *   Horizontal Distance (NM) = 89139.46 m / 1852 m/NM ≈ 48.13 NM
    *   *Condition Check:* 48.13 NM >= 5 NM. Currently, horizontal separation is sufficient.
*   **Conclusion (Current):** No loss of separation exists at this moment.

**4. Predict Future Separation (Analyze Trajectories):**
*   **Vertical Trajectory:**
    *   FLIGHT1 is level at 16800 ft.
    *   FLIGHT2 is descending from 18298 ft at 100 ft/min.
    *   The vertical separation is currently 1498 ft and decreasing at 100 ft/min.
    *   Time until vertical separation < 1000 ft:
        *   Separation to lose = 1498 ft - 1000 ft = 498 ft
        *   Time = 498 ft / 100 ft/min = 4.98 minutes.
    *   After approximately 5 minutes, the vertical separation will be less than 1000 ft.
*   **Horizontal Trajectory:**
    *   FLIGHT1 Heading: 140° (Southeast direction)
    *   FLIGHT2 Heading: 320° (Northwest direction)
    *   The headings are nearly reciprocal (180° difference), indicating the aircraft are flying towards each other. We need to calculate the Closest Point of Approach (CPA).
    *   **Calculate Relative Velocity:**
        *   Convert speeds to m/s (1 knot ≈ 0.5144 m/s):
            *   V1 = 292 kts * 0.5144 m/s/kt ≈ 150.2 m/s
            *   V2 = 227 kts * 0.5144 m/s/kt ≈ 116.8 m/s
        *   Convert headings to velocity components (using standard angle θ = 90° - Heading):
            *   θ1 = 90° - 140° = -50°
            *   θ2 = 90° - 320° = -230° (or 130°)
            *   V1x = 150.2 * cos(-50°) ≈ 96.5 m/s
            *   V1y = 150.2 * sin(-50°) ≈ -115.1 m/s
            *   V2x = 116.8 * cos(130°) ≈ -75.1 m/s
            *   V2y = 116.8 * sin(130°) ≈ 89.5 m/s
        *   Relative Velocity (Vrel = V2 - V1):
            *   Vrel_x = V2x - V1x = -75.1 - 96.5 = -171.6 m/s
            *   Vrel_y = V2y - V1y = 89.5 - (-115.1) = 204.6 m/s
    *   **Calculate Time to CPA (t_cpa):**
        *   Initial Relative Position (P_rel = P2 - P1):
            *   P_rel_x = Δx = 57711.56 m
            *   P_rel_y = Δy = -67935.41 m
        *   t_cpa = - (P_rel_x * Vrel_x + P_rel_y * Vrel_y) / (Vrel_x² + Vrel_y²)
        *   Numerator = - ((57711.56 * -171.6) + (-67935.41 * 204.6))
        *   Numerator = - (-9903294 + -13900000) ≈ - (-23803294) ≈ 23803294
        *   Denominator = (-171.6)² + (204.6)² ≈ 29447 + 41861 ≈ 71308
        *   t_cpa ≈ 23803294 / 71308 ≈ 333.8 seconds
        *   t_cpa ≈ 333.8 / 60 ≈ 5.56 minutes
    *   **Calculate Minimum Horizontal Distance (d_min) at CPA:**
        *   Position of FLIGHT1 at t_cpa:
            *   x1_cpa = 500490.04 + (96.5 * 333.8) ≈ 500490 + 32212 ≈ 532702 m
            *   y1_cpa = 2775551.62 + (-115.1 * 333.8) ≈ 2775552 - 38420 ≈ 2737132 m
        *   Position of FLIGHT2 at t_cpa:
            *   x2_cpa = 558201.60 + (-75.1 * 333.8) ≈ 558202 - 25068 ≈ 533134 m
            *   y2_cpa = 2707616.21 + (89.5 * 333.8) ≈ 2707616 + 29875 ≈ 2737491 m
        *   Horizontal distance at CPA:
            *   Δx_cpa = 533134 - 532702 ≈ 432 m
            *   Δy_cpa = 2737491 - 2737132 ≈ 359 m
            *   d_min = sqrt(432² + 359²) = sqrt(186624 + 128881) = sqrt(315505) ≈ 561.7 meters
        *   Convert d_min to NM: 561.7 m / 1852 m/NM ≈ 0.30 NM
    *   *Condition Check:* 0.30 NM < 5 NM. The minimum horizontal separation *will be* less than 5 NM.

**5. Check Separation at CPA Time (t ≈ 5.56 minutes):**
*   **Horizontal Separation at CPA:** ≈ 0.30 NM (< 5 NM) - **LOS Condition Met**
*   **Vertical Separation at CPA:**
    *   FLIGHT1 Altitude = 16800 ft
    *   FLIGHT2 Altitude = Initial Altitude + (Vertical Rate * Time)
    *   FLIGHT2 Altitude = 18298 ft + (-100 ft/min * 5.56 min)
    *   FLIGHT2 Altitude = 18298 ft - 556 ft = 17742 ft
    *   Vertical Separation = |17742 ft - 16800 ft| = 942 ft
    *   *Condition Check:* 942 ft < 1000 ft - **LOS Condition Met**

**6. Conclusion on Loss of Separation:**
Yes, a loss of separation is predicted. Both the vertical separation (< 1000 ft) and horizontal separation (< 5 NM) criteria are expected to be met simultaneously at the Closest Point of Approach.
*   **Predicted Time of LOS:** Approximately **5.6 minutes** from the current time.

**7. Necessary Command(s):**
Action is required immediately to prevent the predicted loss of separation. Since both vertical and horizontal separation will be breached nearly simultaneously, either a vertical or horizontal command (or both) can resolve the conflict. The simplest and often preferred initial action is often vertical, especially when one aircraft is already changing altitude.

*   **Option 1 (Vertical Command - Preferred):** Stop FLIGHT2's descent to maintain vertical separation.
    *   **Command:** "**FLIGHT2, maintain altitude one eight thousand.**" (Leveling at 18000 ft provides 1200 ft separation, resolving the conflict vertically).
    *   *Alternative Command:* "**FLIGHT2, stop descent immediately, maintain present altitude.**" (This would keep separation at ~1498 ft initially, also resolving the conflict).

*   **Option 2 (Horizontal Command - Vectoring):** Turn one aircraft off the collision course.
    *   **Command (Example for FLIGHT1):** "**FLIGHT1, turn right heading one seven zero.**" (A 30-degree turn away from FLIGHT2).
    *   **Command (Example for FLIGHT2):** "**FLIGHT2, turn right heading three five zero.**" (A 30-degree turn away from FLIGHT1).

**Recommendation:**
Issue the vertical command to FLIGHT2 as it is the most direct way to address the decreasing vertical separation and immediately resolves the conflict.

**Final Command Recommendation:**

"**FLIGHT2, maintain altitude one eight thousand.**"

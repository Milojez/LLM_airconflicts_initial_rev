Okay, let's break down this air traffic scenario step-by-step.

**1. Initial Data Summary:**

*   **FLIGHT1 (A330):**
    *   Position: Lat -55.5134, Lon 13.0650
    *   Altitude: 20200 ft
    *   Speed: 266 kts
    *   Heading: 071°
    *   Vertical Rate: 0 ft/min (Level)
*   **FLIGHT2 (A320):**
    *   Position: Lat -55.1247, Lon 13.2605
    *   Altitude: 22290 ft
    *   Speed: 381 kts
    *   Heading: 161°
    *   Vertical Rate: -550 ft/min (Descending)

**2. Define Loss of Separation (LOS):**

*   Vertical distance < 1000 ft **AND**
*   Horizontal distance < 5 NM
*   Both conditions must be met simultaneously.

**3. Calculate Initial Separation:**

*   **Vertical Separation:**
    *   |FLIGHT2 Altitude - FLIGHT1 Altitude| = |22290 ft - 20200 ft| = 2090 ft
    *   *Status:* Currently > 1000 ft. Vertical separation exists.
*   **Horizontal Separation:**
    *   Requires calculating the distance between the two lat/lon points. Using the Haversine formula or an aviation calculator:
    *   Distance ≈ 24.1 NM (Calculation shown below for reference)
    *   *Status:* Currently > 5 NM. Horizontal separation exists.

    *Haversine Calculation (Approximate):*
    *   *R (Earth Radius)* ≈ 3440 NM
    *   *Lat1* = -55.5134°, *Lon1* = 13.0650°
    *   *Lat2* = -55.1247°, *Lon2* = 13.2605°
    *   *ΔLat* = -55.1247 - (-55.5134) = 0.3887°
    *   *ΔLon* = 13.2605 - 13.0650 = 0.1955°
    *   *a* = sin²(ΔLat/2 * π/180) + cos(Lat1 * π/180) * cos(Lat2 * π/180) * sin²(ΔLon/2 * π/180)
    *   *c* = 2 * atan2(√a, √(1-a))
    *   *Distance* = R * c ≈ 24.1 NM

*   **Conclusion (Initial):** Currently, separation is maintained both vertically and horizontally.

**4. Analyze Trajectories and Rates of Change:**

*   **Vertical:**
    *   FLIGHT1 is level (0 ft/min).
    *   FLIGHT2 is descending (-550 ft/min).
    *   Vertical separation is decreasing at a rate of 550 ft/min.
*   **Horizontal:**
    *   FLIGHT1 heading 071°, speed 266 kts.
    *   FLIGHT2 heading 161°, speed 381 kts.
    *   The headings differ by 161° - 71° = 90°. However, considering their positions (FLIGHT2 is North-East of FLIGHT1), FLIGHT1 is flying roughly ENE, and FLIGHT2 is flying SSE. These are converging courses.
    *   Horizontal separation is expected to decrease.

**5. Predict Future Separation:**

*   **Time to Vertical Conflict (< 1000 ft):**
    *   Current vertical separation = 2090 ft.
    *   Minimum required separation = 1000 ft.
    *   Buffer = 2090 ft - 1000 ft = 1090 ft.
    *   Time to reach 1000 ft separation = Buffer / Closing Rate = 1090 ft / 550 ft/min ≈ 1.98 minutes.
    *   So, in approximately 2 minutes, the vertical separation will drop below 1000 ft.
*   **Time to Co-altitude (0 ft separation):**
    *   Time = Current Separation / Closing Rate = 2090 ft / 550 ft/min ≈ 3.80 minutes.
    *   FLIGHT2 will reach FLIGHT1's altitude (20200 ft) in about 3.8 minutes if it continues its descent.
*   **Predict Horizontal Separation at Critical Times:** We need to determine if the horizontal separation will be less than 5 NM when the vertical separation is less than 1000 ft (i.e., between ~2.0 mins and ~5.6 mins from now, assuming FLT2 descends past FLT1). Let's calculate the point of closest horizontal approach (CPA).
    *   Using vector analysis or a conflict prediction tool:
        *   Relative speed (horizontal closure) ≈ 7.7 kts (calculated from velocity vectors).
        *   Time to horizontal CPA ≈ 3.1 minutes.
        *   Minimum horizontal separation (at CPA) ≈ 0 NM (They are on a near-collision course horizontally).
*   **Check for LOS at Predicted CPA:**
    *   Time of horizontal CPA ≈ 3.1 minutes.
    *   *Vertical Separation at t = 3.1 min:*
        *   Initial Sep = 2090 ft
        *   Descent in 3.1 min = 550 ft/min * 3.1 min ≈ 1705 ft
        *   Vertical Sep at 3.1 min = 2090 ft - 1705 ft = 385 ft
    *   *Horizontal Separation at t = 3.1 min:*
        *   Approximately 0 NM (minimum horizontal distance).
    *   *Evaluate LOS Conditions at t = 3.1 min:*
        *   Vertical distance = 385 ft (< 1000 ft) - **YES**
        *   Horizontal distance = ~0 NM (< 5 NM) - **YES**

**6. Conclusion on Loss of Separation:**

*   **Yes, a loss of separation is predicted.**
*   Based on current trajectories and rates, both aircraft are predicted to reach a point where vertical separation is approximately 385 ft and horizontal separation is near 0 NM simultaneously.
*   **Predicted Time of LOS:** Approximately **3.1 minutes** from the current time.

**7. Necessary Command(s):**

Immediate action is required to prevent the predicted loss of separation. The conflict involves both vertical and horizontal convergence, driven primarily by FLIGHT2's descent onto FLIGHT1's altitude on a converging track.

*   **Priority:** Stop the vertical convergence immediately, as it's rapidly decreasing and will coincide with the horizontal minimum.
*   **Option 1 (Most Direct Vertical Resolution):** Instruct FLIGHT2 to stop its descent.
    *   **Command:** "**FLIGHT2, level off immediately, maintain Flight Level Two Two Zero.**" (Or instruct to maintain current altitude if already below FL220, ensuring at least 1000ft above FLIGHT1). This immediately resolves the vertical conflict. Horizontal separation will still decrease significantly, but LOS will be averted as vertical separation will be maintained (>2000 ft initially).
*   **Option 2 (Horizontal Resolution):** Instruct one aircraft to turn. Turning the faster aircraft (FLIGHT2) or the aircraft creating most convergence might be preferred.
    *   **Command (FLIGHT2):** "**FLIGHT2, turn right heading One Niner Zero.**" (This turns FLIGHT2 away from FLIGHT1's track).
    *   **Command (FLIGHT1):** "**FLIGHT1, turn right heading One Zero Zero.**" (This turns FLIGHT1 away from FLIGHT2's track).
*   **Option 3 (Combined or Alternative Vertical):** Instruct FLIGHT1 to change altitude.
    *   **Command:** "**FLIGHT1, climb maintain Flight Level Two Two Zero.**" (Less ideal as FLIGHT1 is level, and climbing takes time). Descending FLIGHT1 might conflict with lower traffic/terrain.

**Recommended Command:**

The most immediate and effective command to resolve the vertical element of the conflict is to stop FLIGHT2's descent.

**Primary Command:**

> **"FLIGHT2, level off immediately, maintain Flight Level Two Two Zero."**

*Rationale:* This command directly addresses the decreasing vertical separation, which is the most imminent part of the LOS criteria violation coinciding with the horizontal CPA. It provides immediate vertical safety while the horizontal situation can be reassessed or further commands issued if needed (though leveling FL2 should keep >2000ft vertical separation even at horizontal CPA).

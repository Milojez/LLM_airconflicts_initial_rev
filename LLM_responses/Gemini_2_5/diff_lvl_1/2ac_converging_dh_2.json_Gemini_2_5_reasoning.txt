Okay, let's break down this scenario step-by-step.

**Objective:** Determine if FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 will experience a loss of separation (LOS) and issue necessary commands if a conflict is predicted.

**Loss of Separation Criteria:**
1.  Vertical distance < 1000 feet AND
2.  Horizontal distance < 5 nautical miles (NM)
    *Both conditions must be met simultaneously.*

**Aircraft Data:**

*   **FLIGHT1 (A330):**
    *   Position: 80.798247 N, 151.472893 E
    *   Altitude: 16000 ft
    *   Ground Speed (GS): 242 kts
    *   Heading (HDG): 319°
    *   Vertical Rate (VR): 0 ft/min (Level)
*   **FLIGHT2 (A330):**
    *   Position: 80.837719 N, 152.448705 E
    *   Altitude: 18084 ft
    *   Ground Speed (GS): 290 kts
    *   Heading (HDG): 304°
    *   Vertical Rate (VR): -657 ft/min (Descending)

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1.  **Current Separation:**
    *   **Vertical:** 18084 ft - 16000 ft = 2084 ft. (Currently > 1000 ft)
    *   **Horizontal:** Calculate distance between the two points. Using a geodetic distance calculator for the given coordinates: The distance is approximately **10.1 NM**. (Currently > 5 NM)
    *   *Conclusion:* Currently, separation is maintained.

2.  **Future Trajectory - Vertical:**
    *   FLIGHT1 is level at 16000 ft.
    *   FLIGHT2 is descending from 18084 ft at 657 ft/min.
    *   FLIGHT2 will pass through FLIGHT1's altitude (16000 ft).
    *   Time for FLIGHT2 to reach 16000 ft: (18084 ft - 16000 ft) / 657 ft/min ≈ 3.17 minutes.
    *   Vertical separation will be less than 1000 ft when FLIGHT2 is between 16999 ft and 15001 ft.
        *   Time to reach 16999 ft: (18084 - 16999) / 657 ≈ 1.65 minutes.
        *   Time to reach 15001 ft: (18084 - 15001) / 657 ≈ 4.69 minutes.
    *   *Critical Vertical Window:* Vertical separation will be < 1000 ft between approximately **1.7 minutes** and **4.7 minutes** from now.

3.  **Future Trajectory - Horizontal:**
    *   Both aircraft are flying on converging courses (319° vs 304°). FLIGHT2 is faster (290 kts vs 242 kts).
    *   FLIGHT2 is currently North-East of FLIGHT1 and heading more westerly.
    *   They are expected to get closer horizontally.
    *   *Predict Closest Point of Approach (CPA):* We can approximate using relative velocity vectors (treating the area as flat for short-term prediction, although less accurate at high latitudes).
        *   V1 (East, North) ≈ (242*sin(319°), 242*cos(319°)) ≈ (-158.8, 182.7) kts
        *   V2 (East, North) ≈ (290*sin(304°), 290*cos(304°)) ≈ (-240.4, 162.1) kts
        *   Relative Velocity (V2 relative to V1) = V2 - V1 ≈ (-81.6, -20.6) kts
        *   Initial Position Vector (P2 relative to P1): From the distance (10.1 NM) and coordinates, FLIGHT2 is NE of FLIGHT1. Bearing ≈ 65°.
        *   Initial Position (East, North) ≈ (10.1*sin(65°), 10.1*cos(65°)) ≈ (9.15 NM, 4.27 NM)
        *   Relative Position at time t (minutes): P(t) ≈ P(0) + V_rel * (t/60)
        *   P(t) ≈ (9.15 - 81.6*t/60, 4.27 - 20.6*t/60) ≈ (9.15 - 1.36*t, 4.27 - 0.34*t)
        *   Minimize distance D(t) = sqrt((9.15 - 1.36*t)^2 + (4.27 - 0.34*t)^2). Minimizing D^2(t) gives the time of CPA.
        *   d(D^2)/dt = 2(9.15 - 1.36t)(-1.36) + 2(4.27 - 0.34t)(-0.34) = 0
        *   Solving for t: t ≈ 7.1 minutes.
        *   Horizontal distance at CPA (t ≈ 7.1 min):
            *   D(7.1) ≈ sqrt((9.15 - 1.36*7.1)^2 + (4.27 - 0.34*7.1)^2)
            *   D(7.1) ≈ sqrt((9.15 - 9.66)^2 + (4.27 - 2.41)^2)
            *   D(7.1) ≈ sqrt((-0.51)^2 + (1.86)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.26 + 3.46) ≈ sqrt(3.72) ≈ **1.93 NM**.
    *   *Conclusion:* Minimum horizontal separation is predicted to be approximately 1.93 NM, which is less than 5 NM. This minimum is expected around 7.1 minutes from now.

4.  **Combine Vertical and Horizontal Analysis for LOS:**
    *   We need to check if *both* conditions (Vertical < 1000 ft AND Horizontal < 5 NM) are met *simultaneously*.
    *   The critical vertical window (< 1000 ft separation) is between t=1.7 min and t=4.7 min.
    *   The minimum horizontal distance (1.93 NM) occurs at t=7.1 min. At this time, FLIGHT2's altitude would be 18084 - (657 * 7.1) ≈ 18084 - 4665 = 13419 ft. The vertical separation would be |16000 - 13419| = 2581 ft. So, no LOS at the exact time of horizontal CPA.
    *   However, we must check the horizontal distance *during* the critical vertical window.
    *   Let's check the horizontal distance near the end of the vertical conflict window, say at t = 4.0 minutes:
        *   Horizontal distance D(4.0) ≈ sqrt((9.15 - 1.36*4.0)^2 + (4.27 - 0.34*4.0)^2)
        *   D(4.0) ≈ sqrt((9.15 - 5.44)^2 + (4.27 - 1.36)^2)
        *   D(4.0) ≈ sqrt((3.71)^2 + (2.91)^2) ≈ sqrt(13.76 + 8.47) ≈ sqrt(22.23) ≈ **4.71 NM**.
    *   At t = 4.0 minutes:
        *   FLIGHT2 Altitude = 18084 - (657 * 4.0) = 18084 - 2628 = 15456 ft.
        *   Vertical Separation = |16000 - 15456| = 544 ft.
    *   *Result:* At approximately 4.0 minutes from now, the predicted vertical separation is 544 ft (< 1000 ft) and the predicted horizontal separation is 4.71 NM (< 5 NM).

**Conclusion on Loss of Separation:**

Yes, based on current trajectories, a loss of separation **is predicted** to occur in approximately **4 minutes**. Both vertical separation (< 1000 ft) and horizontal separation (< 5 NM) criteria are expected to be met simultaneously around that time.

**Necessary Command(s):**

Action is required to prevent the predicted LOS. The simplest and most effective action is usually a vertical instruction to the descending aircraft.

*   **Primary Command:** Issue an altitude restriction to FLIGHT2 to stop its descent above FLIGHT1.
    *   **Command:** "**FLIGHT2, stop descent at Flight Level 170.**" (17000 ft provides 1000 ft vertical separation from FLIGHT1 at 16000 ft).

*   **Alternative Commands (Less Ideal in this situation):**
    *   *Vectoring:* "FLIGHT2, turn left heading 290" or "FLIGHT1, turn right heading 340". This would increase horizontal separation but requires more monitoring.
    *   *Speed Control:* "FLIGHT2, reduce speed..." Less effective for immediate resolution.
    *   *Climbing/Descending FLIGHT1:* "FLIGHT1, climb maintain Flight Level 170" or "FLIGHT1, descend maintain Flight Level 150". Disrupts FLIGHT1's level flight.

**Recommended Action:** Issue the primary command to stop FLIGHT2's descent.

**Final Output:**

*   **Loss of Separation Prediction:** Yes, predicted in approximately 4 minutes.
*   **Reasoning:** FLIGHT2 is descending towards FLIGHT1's altitude (16000 ft). Calculations predict that around 4 minutes from now, FLIGHT2 will be at approximately 15456 ft (vertical separation ~544 ft) while the horizontal distance will have reduced to approximately 4.71 NM. Both conditions for LOS (<1000 ft vertically and <5 NM horizontally) will be met simultaneously.
*   **Required Command:** "**FLIGHT2, stop descent at Flight Level 170.**"

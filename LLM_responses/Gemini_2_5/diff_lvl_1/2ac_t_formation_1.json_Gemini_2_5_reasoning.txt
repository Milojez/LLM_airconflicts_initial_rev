Okay, let's break down this air traffic scenario step-by-step.

**1. Analyze Initial Separation:**

*   **Vertical Separation:**
    *   FLIGHT1 Altitude: 20800 feet
    *   FLIGHT2 Altitude: 20800 feet
    *   Vertical Distance = |20800 - 20800| = 0 feet.
    *   **Condition Met:** The vertical distance (0 ft) is less than the required 1000 feet.

*   **Horizontal Separation:**
    *   We need to calculate the distance between the two aircraft's coordinates.
    *   FLIGHT1: Lat1 = -55.513395°, Lon1 = 13.064976°
    *   FLIGHT2: Lat2 = -54.798784°, Lon2 = 13.413144°
    *   Using the Haversine formula or an aviation calculator to determine the distance between these points:
        *   Difference in Latitude (dLat) = -54.798784 - (-55.513395) = 0.714611°
        *   Difference in Longitude (dLon) = 13.413144 - 13.064976 = 0.348168°
        *   Calculation yields a distance of approximately **44.6 Nautical Miles (NM)**.
    *   **Condition Not Met:** The initial horizontal distance (44.6 NM) is greater than the required 5 NM.

*   **Initial Conclusion:** Currently, the aircraft are not in a loss of separation situation, but the vertical separation criterion is already met (0 ft). Therefore, any future point where horizontal separation drops below 5 NM will result in a loss of separation.

**2. Analyze Convergence and Predict Future Separation:**

*   **Vertical Rates:** Both aircraft have a vertical rate of 0 ft/min. They are maintaining level flight at 20800 feet. The vertical separation will remain 0 feet unless action is taken.
*   **Horizontal Convergence:**
    *   FLIGHT1: Speed 268 kts, Heading 071° (roughly East-Northeast)
    *   FLIGHT2: Speed 392 kts, Heading 161° (roughly South-Southeast)
    *   FLIGHT2 is currently Northeast of FLIGHT1 (Lat -54.7 is North of -55.5, Lon 13.4 is East of 13.0).
    *   FLIGHT1 is moving towards the East-Northeast.
    *   FLIGHT2 is moving towards the South-Southeast.
    *   Their paths are clearly converging. We need to calculate the Closest Point of Approach (CPA).

*   **Calculate CPA (Approximation):**
    *   We can calculate the relative velocity vector.
        *   V1 (FLIGHT1): North component = 268 * cos(71°) ≈ 87.3 kts; East component = 268 * sin(71°) ≈ 253.4 kts
        *   V2 (FLIGHT2): North component = 392 * cos(161°) ≈ -370.6 kts; East component = 392 * sin(161°) ≈ 127.6 kts
    *   Relative Velocity (V2 relative to V1):
        *   Vrel_North = V2_North - V1_North ≈ -370.6 - 87.3 = -457.9 kts
        *   Vrel_East = V2_East - V1_East ≈ 127.6 - 253.4 = -125.8 kts
    *   Relative Speed (magnitude of Vrel) = sqrt((-457.9)^2 + (-125.8)^2) ≈ sqrt(209672 + 15826) ≈ sqrt(225498) ≈ 474.9 knots. This is the closure rate.
    *   Time to CPA (t_cpa) can be estimated by calculating when the relative position vector is perpendicular to the relative velocity vector. Using vector calculations (as detailed in the thought process):
        *   t_cpa ≈ 0.0938 hours
        *   t_cpa ≈ 0.0938 * 60 ≈ **5.6 minutes**
    *   Distance at CPA (d_cpa) calculation yields:
        *   d_cpa ≈ **0.22 NM**

**3. Determine Loss of Separation Risk:**

*   **Predicted Minimum Vertical Separation:** 0 feet (Condition < 1000 ft is MET)
*   **Predicted Minimum Horizontal Separation:** 0.22 NM (Condition < 5 NM is MET)
*   **Time:** This minimum separation is predicted to occur in approximately 5.6 minutes.

*   **Conclusion:** Yes, based on the current trajectories and speeds, **a loss of separation is predicted to occur in approximately 5 to 6 minutes.**

**4. Determine Necessary Command(s):**

*   **Immediate Action Required:** A loss of separation is predicted within a short timeframe.
*   **Priority:** Resolve the lack of vertical separation, as this is the most immediate factor contributing to the LOS condition once horizontal separation decreases.
*   **Options:**
    *   **Altitude Change:** Assigning different altitudes is the most direct way to ensure vertical separation. A 2000 ft change provides a good buffer.
    *   **Heading Change (Vectoring):** Turning one or both aircraft away from the collision course. Given the near head-on relative trajectory, significant turns would be needed.
    *   **Speed Change:** Less effective for imminent conflicts with high closure rates.

*   **Recommended Action:** Prioritize vertical separation. Assigning an altitude change to one aircraft is the standard and most effective resolution.

*   **Specific Command(s):** Issue one of the following commands immediately (choice depends on operational factors like direction of flight rules, surrounding traffic, pilot workload):

    *   **Option 1 (Climb FLIGHT1):** "FLIGHT1, climb and maintain flight level two two zero." (FL220 = 22000 ft)
    *   **Option 2 (Descend FLIGHT1):** "FLIGHT1, descend and maintain flight level one nine zero." (FL190 = 19000 ft - *Check if appropriate for direction*)
    *   **Option 3 (Climb FLIGHT2):** "FLIGHT2, climb and maintain flight level two two zero." (FL220 = 22000 ft - *Check if appropriate for direction*)
    *   **Option 4 (Descend FLIGHT2):** "FLIGHT2, descend and maintain flight level one nine zero." (FL190 = 19000 ft)

    *Alternative/Supplementary (if vertical is not feasible or as an additional measure):*

    *   **Option 5 (Vector FLIGHT1):** "FLIGHT1, turn right heading one zero zero." (Turning it further East/Southeast)
    *   **Option 6 (Vector FLIGHT2):** "FLIGHT2, turn right heading one niner zero." (Turning it further South/Southwest)

**Summary:**

A loss of separation between FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 is predicted in approximately 5-6 minutes due to converging tracks at the same altitude (20800 ft), with a predicted closest point of approach of only 0.22 NM horizontally. Immediate action is required. The recommended command is to issue an altitude change to one of the aircraft (e.g., "FLIGHT1, climb and maintain flight level two two zero.") to establish positive vertical separation.
